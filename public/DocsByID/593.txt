Troy, Excavation of

The existence and geographical location of Troy, the legendary setting of the Trojan War described in Homer’s Iliad, received little attention until the nineteenth century. In the 1860s, British diplomat Frank Calvert (1828-1908) began digging at Hisarlik, a mound on the Anatolian coast in Turkey, and convinced German businessman and amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann (1822-1890) to continue excavations in the area. Schliemann took up work in 1871 and in 1873 uncovered fortifications and the remains of a city of great antiquity. He also found a trove of gold and copper artefacts, which he labelled ‘Priam’s treasure’. While the treasure’s authenticity is still debated, Schliemann’s identification of Hisarlik as Troy is now widely accepted. Indeed, in several campaigns until 1890, Schliemann discovered not only Homeric Troy, but also a prehistoric Bronze Age civilisation. Schliemann was a pioneering fieldwork archaeologist who introduced new scientific methods; he also popularized his findings in books and newspaper articles and was an inspiration to scholars and the general public alike. Long considered a hobby for amateurs and adventurers, archaeology now became an academic discipline. Schliemann’s findings also encouraged modern writers’ interest in myth and created a new climate for the study of history and civilisation. Excavations at Hisarlik are ongoing (http://bit.ly/9TGLxA) and have revealed ten cities built in succession.
