Ahmad Osman is a prominent Egyptian sculptor and decorator. He studied at
the School of Decorative Arts in Cairo under the English painter and
decorator William Arnold Stewart (1882-1953). After graduating in 1927, he
received a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Rome.
When he returned to Egypt in 1933, he was appointed professor at the School
of Applied Arts in Giza (former School of Decorative Arts). He worked as
the director of the Sculpture Department of the School of Fine Arts in
Cairo in 1937 before he decided to establish the Faculty of Fine Arts in
Alexandria where he became its first director in 1957. Osman was
commissioned to sculpt and decorate several public monuments in Egypt.
While his early sculptures employ characteristics of Italian classicism,
towards the end of his career, he shifted to a more realistic style in
depicting the features of the Egyptian peasants in their daily activities.
