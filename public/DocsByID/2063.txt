Walden’s first wife, the poet Else Lasker-Schüler, whose works he set to music, bestowed the utopian name on him. Walden founded the journal, Der Sturm, in 1910. His contacts through Lasker-Schüler, his piano teacher Conrad Ansorge, and the Viennese writer Karl Kraus and architect Adolf Loos ensured the journal’s success. Expressionist writers such as Alfred Döblin and August Stramm debuted in its pages. In 1912, Walden opened Der Sturm gallery, which hosted Expressionist, Futurist, Cubist, and Constructivist art exhibitions. Walden increased the visibility of female artists, such as Sonia Delaunay and Gabriele Münter, and Wassily Kandinsky and Kurt Schwitters gained renown at his gallery. Yet in the 1920s, Walden’s uncanny capacity to recognize talent diminished, and Der Sturm ceased publication in 1932. Walden emigrated to the Soviet Union, where he sought a communist utopia, only to die in a Stalinist camp in 1941.
