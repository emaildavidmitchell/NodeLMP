Aragon, Louis (1897-1982)



Louis Aragon was a member of the surrealist movement until he split with André Breton and began to devote more of his energy to the Communist Party. He is best known for his love poetry and his novel, Paris Peasant.

Louis Aragon by Henri Matisse.Aragon was born and died in Paris, the city that played a major role in much of his writing. Because his mother was only seventeen when she gave birth to him, Aragon was raised to believe that his mother was his sister, his grandmother was his foster mother, and his father, the French senator Louis Andrieux, was his godfather. Aragon was only told of his true parentage at nineteen when he was leaving for service in the First World War and not expected to return. For the rest of his life, Andrieux would refuse to acknowledge paternity, a fact later thematised in Aragon’s writing.

	

Educated as a physician, Aragon joined the army medical corps and met André Breton there. The two joined Dada in 1919 and became founding members of the surrealist movement along with Philippe Soupault in 1924. Aragon’s first two poem collections were highly surrealist in style, but he was criticized by the group after he published Le Paysan de Paris (Paris Peasant), a novel and dialectical meditation on areas of Paris about to be destroyed by modernisation. This book deeply influenced the philosopher Walter Benjamin. Soon after he joined the Communist Party in 1927, Aragon was ejected from the surrealist movement.

	



Louis Aragon and Elsa Triolet

Louis Aragon and Elsa TrioletAragon became a journalist for the Communist Party’s newspaper, L’Humanité, and was chosen as founding editor of the party’s new newspaper Ce Soir, which he used to animate public opinion during the Spanish Civil War. Mobilized by the French army in 1939, he joined the French Resistance immediately after its defeat, committing acts of resistance as well as writing for underground presses including Les Editions de Minuit. In 1939 Aragon married the Russian-born Elsa Triolet, sister of Lili Brik, the mistress of Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. During the war, Aragon and Triolet co-authored Resistance articles for several underground papers, one of which they co-edited, and influenced each other’s fiction. Aragon also wrote collections of poetry inspired by Triolet, declaring her his muse. The Communist aesthetic of social realism and wartime urgency influenced him to return to a more classical style of writing and historically based subjects.

	

After Liberation, Aragon became a leading public intellectual and an official of the French Communist Party. Yet he was increasingly disenchanted by Stalinist repression, and distanced himself soon after the Budapest insurrection of 1956. Aragon published dissidents such as Alexander Solzenitsyn and Milan Kundera and strongly supported the Prague Spring and the student uprisings in 1968. Despite his criticisms, however, he remained an official member of the French Communist Party (PCF) until his death.

	

Aragon was an influential literary editor until 1972, when he closed down Les Lettres Françaises, the literary supplement of L’Humanité. He then returned to his surrealist roots, publishing several more novels. As a writer, Aragon participated in the full course of twentieth-century French literature, including dada, surrealism, socialist realism, and the nouveau roman. Countless poems of his have been set to music, and many have become popular songs, performed by artists such as Marc Ogeret.
