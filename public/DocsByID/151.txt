Barakat, Tayseer (1959--)

Tayseer Barakat was born in 1959 in Jabalia Refugee Camp in Gaza, and studied painting at the College of Fine Arts in Alexandria, Egypt. He was one of the founding members of Al Wasiti Art Centre in Jerusalem in the 1990s and founded The International Academy of Art, Palestine in Ramallah in the mid 2000s. He participated in several exhibitions in the Middle East and Europe, in group shows of Palestinian art, and his work is held in private collections. His practice began in oil painting, exploring the urban environment and children playing, particular memories of Gaza and the steadfastness of the people. In his later work he moved to working in mixed media, including ink drawings inspired by ancient civilizations; abstract figures inhabit and traverse his desert landscapes and vast terrains in monochromatic colors. In the 1990s, he became deeply engaged in exploring found materials, particularly wood, and developed his unique style of inscriptions on wood through burning processes. He created numerous relief works and assemblages in this style, developing imprints that resemble individual figures. His monumental installation work in boxes of sand in 2003 explored the sense of loss and longing, and in 2006, he became inspired by prisoners’ letters.
