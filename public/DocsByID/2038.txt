Carlos Ral Villanueva
(born May 30, 1900, London, died August 16, 1975, Caracas)

Carlos Ral Villanueva is the most renowned Venezuelan modern architect,
designer of several social housing developments as El Silencio  (1941-45)
and 23 de Enero (1955-57) and also of one of the most singular examples
of Modern Architecture in Latin Amrica, the Ciudad Universitaria of
Caracas, campus of Central University of Venezuela (1944-70), declared
UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000. Villanueva was born when his father was
part of the Venezuelan diplomatic service. His childhood and youth was
spent in Europe, most of it in France, where he studied, first in the Lyce
Condorcet and later in lEcole des Beaux Arts de Paris, graduating as an
architect in 1928. Villanueva developed his professional work in Venezuela
between 1930 and 1970. During these forty years he embraced the biggest
ideal of the modern architect: to work for the common man, for society as a
whole, devoting himself to the service of the Venezuelan State. In 1937
Villanueva returned to France for seven months. The project for the
Venezuelan pavilion for the Paris International Expo, designed with Luis
Malaussena, gave him the opportunity to again be in the midst of artistic
avant-gardes. In Paris Villanueva studied Urbanism at the University of
Paris and attendance of the 5thCIAM meeting,both of which helped to
consolidate his credo in modern architecture and in the synthesis of arts.

Villanueva played a prominent role in the modernization of his country and
the construction of its welfare, designing public buildings in Caracas and
other cities. While his capacities to deal with the contexts climatic and
cultural specificities grew, Villanueva was increasingly bold in promoting
the modernist tenets and avant-gardist approach he experienced in Europe.
By 1940 he had gathered enough familiarity with his context of origin to be
at the lead of a twenty-year long experimentation in the field of public
housing within the Banco Obrero (BO), the National Housing Agency. During
this period, he took part in the planning and conception of numerous
urbanizaciones, located mostly in the Venezuelan capital city. Villanueva
founded the Taller de Arquitectura del Banco Obrero (TABO), an architecture
department that would experiment on low-cost dwelling types and
construction techniques to qualitatively house in-migrants and resettle
rancho dwellers. Work at the TABO became an opportunity to endorse and
revisit CIAM planning principles, innovating multi-story residential
typologies and neighborhood design. This occurred without neglecting the
collaboration with artists that had already distinguished his earlier
design, and made manifest by the polychromatic treatment of superbloques.

Villanueva started to work in 1944 on his masterpiece, the University
Campus in Caracas. This complex represents a synthesis of Villanuevas
architectural philosophy and of his deep-rooted concept of the architects
public function. He dedicated to the project and construction more than 25
years of work until he completed a complex that covers a surface of ninety
acres with some forty buildings. The Ciudad Universitaria is an exceptional
example of modern urbanism and a creative synthesis of architecture,
plastic arts and environment. The campus is an urban complex scored by the
movement of the body and the survey of the eye. Works of Henri Laurens,
Jean Arp, Fernand Leger, Victor Vasarely, Antoine Pevsner, Andr Bloc,
Wifredo Lam, Baltazar Lobo, Alexander Calder and venezuelan artists like
Alejandro Otero, Victor Valera, Mateo Manaure, Pascual Navarro, Oswaldo
Vigas and Francisco Narvez are articulated by architecture. The Aula Magna
is the heart of the campus, a marvelous dream of Villanueva and Calder and
the Roofed Square is an open air museum and a landmark in Latin American
architecture. At his death in 1975, Villanueva was an internationally
acclaimed architect, as the numerous awards, recognitions and published
projects demonstrate. His writings illustrate a profound belief in
architecture as a service to society, and the significance to reconcile pre-
colonial, colonial and modern architectural cultures.
