Malle, Louis (1932-1995)



Louis Malle (30 October 1932-23 November 1995) was a French filmmaker associated with the French New Wave of the 1950s and 1960s. He directed dozens of films in both French and English in a variety of genres and styles, from documentaries (Le Monde du silence [The Silent World, 1956]) to crime drama (Ascenseur pour l’échafaud [Elevator to the Gallows, 1957]) to screwball comedy (Zazie dans le metro, 1960). His willingness to explore different cinematic styles and genres sometimes put him outside of the New Wave as defined by the critic-filmmakers of the influential journal Cahiers du cinema. Nevertheless, his emphasis on narrative ambiguity, personal storytelling and taboo-breaking are in keeping with the interests of that cohort of filmmakers. His films are well-known for their thematic controversy (as in Pretty Baby, 1978) and narrative experimentation (as in My Dinner with André, 1981). His film soundtracks often featured jazz, most famously in Elevator to the Gallows, for which Miles Davis improvised the score. Malle sometimes incorporated surrealist elements in his films, a good example being Black Moon (1975). His final film, Vanya on 42nd Street (1994), is arguably more postmodernist than modernist. It intertwines scenes of a rehearsal of Anton Chekhov’s play Uncle Vanya with behind-the-scene interludes, in a redeployment of the play’s Russian concerns about environmental and social instability to contemporary American anxieties about urban and artistic decay.
