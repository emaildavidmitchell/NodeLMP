Khodasevich before the 1917

Revolution.Vladislav Khodasevich was one of the preeminent Russian poets and critics of the emigration. Born in Moscow on 28 May 1886 (16 May Old-Style), he began as an acolyte of Valery BRIUSOV and the SYMBOLISTS. His major work begins with Putem zerna (Grain’s Way, 1920), which demonstrates the irony, detachment and even biliousness that would become his trademark. In 1922 he emigrated with NINA BERBEROVA to Europe where, in poor health, he lived a difficult and peripatetic life for years before settling in Paris. In emigration he released one final collection: Evropeiskaia noch’ (European Night, 1927 as part of his Sobranie stikhov [Collected Verse]) after which he fell into poetic silence. However, he remained a prolific critic, engaging in a prolonged debate with Georgy Adamovich, among others, over the nature of Russian émigré literature. Khodasevich argued for a closer relationship with the classical Russian tradition rather than the European tradition. He also produced valuable work on the poet Alexander Pushkin, his life-long obsession, and a biography of Derzhavin (1931). His memoirs of the literary figures he knew personally, including Maksim Gorky and Andrei BELY (Nekropol’ (Necropolis), 1939), were published shortly before his death from cancer on 14 June 1939.
