Jouve, Pierre Jean  (1887- 1976)

Pierre Jean Jouve was a French novelist and poet. His extensive body of
work is best known for his innovative representation of psychoanalysis and
Christian mysticism in his prose and poems. His novels (from Paulina 1880
(1925) to La Scne Capitale (1935)) and poetry demonstrate a fascination
with female psychology and eroticism in particular. In 1921, Jouve began
affair with psychoanalyst Blanche Reverchon, who would become his second
wife. Influenced by Reverchon, he undertook an intensive study of Freudian
psychoanalytic theory and mystic poetry that would permanently change the
course of his work. Jouve formally announced this new direction in 1928
with the publication of a collection of poems titled Les Noces, in which he
disavowed all works prior to 1924. Despite this acknowledged break with the
pacifist movement in politics and literature, he remained a politically
engaged writer. During World War II, Jouve openly criticized the Nazi and
fascist regimes in his writings. In 1941, due to this condemnation, he went
into exile in Switzerland until the end of the war. After his return to
Paris, he published a collection of his poetry from the war years titled,
La Vierge de Paris (1946). In his critical autobiography En Miroir (1954)
Jouve provides analysis and insight into his development as writer.
