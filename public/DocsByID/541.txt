														Summary

														Françoise and Dominique Dupuy are French dancers, teachers, choreographers and writers who met in Paris in 1946 and were married in 1951.

In 1955 they founded Les Ballets modernes de Paris (BMP), one of France’s first modern dance companies and initiated a collaboration of more than six decades as members of Jean Weidt’s company, Ballets des arts. Prolific writers as well as choreographers, in 1969 they founded Rencontres internationales de danse contemporaine (International Encounters of Contemporary Dance, RIDC), a pioneering teacher-training institution, and in 1996 Le Mas de la danse (Provençal House of Dance), a research and study centre for contemporary dance as well as a publishing house.  Une Danse à l’œuvre, a co-authored collection of essays on their dance practise, was published in 2001.  Now in their eighties, they continue to explore the themes of heritage, memory and the aging dancer.  

														

Training

														The couple’s dance background was eclectic.  Françoise received early training in Dalcroze eurhythmics with Hélène Carlut, then studied ballet-inspired modern technique with Marguerite Bugai, ballet with Youly Algaroff and Nicolas Zvereff, and mime with Etienne Decroux.  Dominique began his dance training with Jean Weidt, then studied ballet with Alice Vronska and Olga Preobrajenska and acting with Charles Dullin and Marcel Marceau. The couple danced in La Cellule (The Cell), the award-winning piece of the 1947 choreographic competition sponsored by the Archives Internationales de la Danse. On this occasion they met Jacqueline Robinson, who became a life-long friend and colleague.

														

Contributions to the Field and to Modernism

														Known as Françoise and Dominique, the couple worked on the music-hall stage in the early 1950s.  In 1955 they founded Les Ballets modernes de Paris (BMP), one of France’s first modern dance companies to receive state funding. In 1957 they invited Deryk Mendel to choreograph a piece for the company. The result was Epithalame (Epithalamium, 1957), which won first prize at the Aix-les-Bains competition and was restaged in 2005.

														The defining moment of their careers was the founding of their Paris studio in 1954.  Located at 104 Boulevard de Clichy, the studio became a centre for a multitude of activities – teaching, performance, choreography, education and research.  Like Jacqueline Robinson, the Dupuys have never taught a codified technique but instead have sought to train well-rounded dancers.

														

														The couple’s encounter with the master teacher Jerome Andrews (whom they consider their ‘maître’) was equally defining.  In his workshops they were introduced to his interpretations of both classical and modern dance techniques as well as yoga and Pilates. Andrews choreographed three pieces for the Ballets modernes de Paris (BMP): Le jour où la terre tremblera (The Day When the Earth Trembled, 1960), Capture éphémère (Ephemeral Capture, 1967) and Le Masque de la double étoile (The Mask of the Double Star,1968). 

														

														After disbanding Les Ballets modernes de Paris (BMP) in 1978, the Dupuys undertook individual projects whilst continuing to work together. Françoise focused on conducting teacher training courses at the Rencontres internationales de danse contemporaine (RIDC) and, beginning in 1985, directed Danse à l’école, a successful project incorporating dance into the primary school curriculum. 

														

														Along with Jacqueline Robinson, the Dupuys were active in the Syndicat national des auteurs et compositeurs (National Union of Authors and Composers, SNAC), Conseil national de la danse (National Dance Council) and Société des auteurs et compositeurs dramatiques (Society of Dramatic Authors and Composers, SACD), working tirelessly to raise the status of dancers, choreographers and teachers. Both Françoise and Dominique were appointed inspectors by the Ministry of Culture in 1985 and 1989.  

														

														Prolific choreographers, the Dupuys collaborated on many works, while also producing dances individually.  Among their best known works are Marinada (1953), Le mandarin merveilleux (The Marvellous Mandarin,1965), Le bal des gueux (The Beggars’ Ball, 1976) and Faits d’artifice (Artificial Facts, 2001).  They also contributed choreography to theatre works such as Le Bourgeois gentilhomme (The Bourgeois Gentleman, 1960) and Médée (Medea, 1965).  The Dupuys also made a number of works with broadly defined political themes. Visages de femmes (Faces of Women, 1973) dealt with the status of women in wartime Algeria. Dominique’s solo works Le cercle dans tous ses états (The Circle in All Its States, 1979), Trajectoires (Trajectories, 1981) and En vol (Flying, 1983) on the solitude of the dancer. L’Estran (The Strand, 2005) and Le Regard par dessus le col (A View Above the Peak, 2007) featured Françoise dancing at the age of eighty.

Legacy

														Advocates of decentralisation, the couple has actively promoted dance outside Paris. In 1962 the two established the Beaux-de-Provence festival, which continued until 1969 and brought international artists such as Merce Cunningham before the French public. Generations of French modern dancers, including Brigitte Hyon, Joëlle Bouvier, Régis Obadia, Marie-France Delieuvin, Bernadette Leguil and José Montalvo, were trained by the Dupuys. Still active today, they continue to teach master classes at the Centre national de la danse (National Centre of Dance) in Paris as well as abroad. Through La Mas de la danse they continue to publish their own writings in addition to pursuing interdisciplinary projects such as the journal  Quant à la danse journal (2004-2008).
