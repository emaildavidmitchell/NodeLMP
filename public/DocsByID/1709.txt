He co-founded Artists Space, a non-profit exhibition gallery, in 1972 where the Irving Sandler Artists File registry is still housed. Sandler is particularly associated with Abstract Expressionism and knew most of its artists personally. In his writing he often employs a factual rather than a theoretical approach.  His widely referenced and somewhat controversial, Triumph of American Painting: A History of American Expressionism (1970), is a standard survey of the movement. He also authored several monographs, including Judy Pfaff and Alex Katz: A Retrospective.
