Sterne, Hedda (1910-2011)						Word Count: 192

Born and educated in Bucharest and formally trained in Vienna and Paris, Hedda Sterne immigrated to New York City in 1941.  She is most well-known for having been the only female artist in the now famous 1951 Life photograph of the “Irascibles;” a group of eighteen artists, including Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) and Mark Rothko (1903-1970),  who protested the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s conservative policies.  While Sterne preferred not to align herself with any specific artistic trends or movements, she is often associated with Abstract Expressionism as a result of this photograph and stated that Surrealism was her first influence.  Sterne’s work varied throughout her career from abstraction to figurative; she is also known for having experimented with mediums including collage and sprayed paint.  Hedda Sterne received her first of over-forty solo exhibitions in 1943 at the Wakefield Gallery in New York.
