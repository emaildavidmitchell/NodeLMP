Exter, Alexandra Alexandrovna Grigorovich (1882-1949)

ABSTRACT

Alexandra Exter was an influential Russian modernist painter and designer.
Very much a part of modernist trends  Cubism, Simultaneism  in Paris,
Exter brought their ideas to her friends in Russia, thereby contributing to
the rise of modernism and the Russian avant-garde. She was a major
contributor to the stream of modernism that explored colour and its laws. .
Although she played a significant role in the development of the early
Soviet art scene, the political situation motivated Exter to emigrate to
Paris in 1924, where she taught composition and colour in the studio of
Fernand Lger, the Acadmie Moderne (1925-1929) while also teaching theatre
design in her own studio.

TEXT

Born on 6 January 1882 in Bialostok, Belorussia, Imperial Russia, Exter
first exhibited in the Kiev avant-garde exhibition The Link [Zveno,
1908], showed paintings in a pointillist style that she had created in 1907
in France and Switzerland. After passing through a brief Czanne-influenced
period, during 1911 and 1912 she adopted the structural principles of
Cubism. During 1913-1915, she took up the colour ideas of Parisian
Simultaneism from Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay and the Synchromists. For
these artists, colour is what the eye sees before it sees objects, making
the world a fantastic display of shapes of moving colour shifting between
light and dark. They depicted this display in their paintings (e.g. R.
Delaunay, Solar Disc, 1912; S. Delaunay, Le Bal Bullier, 1913). Exter
captured the city at night in a series of paintings that became
increasingly non-objective as patches of colours began to predominate over
objects. Returning to Russia in 1914, she was associated with the Cubo-
Futurist painters  K. Malevich, L. Popova, et al.  and in 1916, like
these and other artists, she was using spinning discs to capture moving
colour in light. Exters Dynamism of Colour series (1916-1918) was
entirely non-objective and was followed by her Colour Constructions
(composed with beams of light from projectors onto a screen [1920-1924])
and the Dynamics of Colour series (using the circular movement of
machines). She was a major contributor to the stream of modernism that
explored colour and its laws.

Very much a part of modernist trends  Cubism, Simultaneism  in Paris,
Exter brought their ideas to her friends in Russia, thereby contributing to
the rise of modernism and the Russian avant-garde. Because of the First
World War and then the 1917 October Revolution, Exter remained based in
Russia during the early 1920s, where she not only took part in exhibitions
of non-objective art but also became engaged in costume and set design for
the theatre (Thamira Kitharides, 1916, Salome, 1917, Romeo and Juliet, 1921
for Alexander Tairoff and his Kamerny Theatre, Moscow), and for film (J.
Protozanovs, Aelita, 1924). Living in Kiev from 1917 to 1918, she was
involved in arts programmes for the Bolshevik regime. In an official
capacity she was responsible for installation of the Russian section at the
Venice Biennale (1924) and the Paris Exposition des Arts Dcoratifs et
Industriels Modernes (1925), where she was awarded a gold medal for her
theatre work. The political situation in Russia motivated Exter to emigrate
to Paris, where she began to paint in the Purist style and taught
composition and colour in the studio of Fernand Lger, the Acadmie Moderne
(1925-1929) while also teaching theatre design in her own studio. In the
1930s she added book design to her design pursuits. She died on 17 March
1949 in Fontenay-aux-Roses, near Paris.
