Husseini, Jumana (1932--)



Jumana Husseini was born in 1932 in Jerusalem. Her family were forced to leave Palestine in the 1948 war and settled in Lebanon. She married Ofran Bayazid in 1950 and between 1953-1956 studied political science at the American University of Beirut where she discovered her interest in art. She participated in group exhibitions in Lebanon, the Middle East and Europe, including at the Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, Japan, The Barbican Center, London, UK and the Institute de Monde Arabe, Paris, France. In 1991, she studied stained glass art at the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Her early works appear like scenes from a window looking at architectural elements from a house in Jerusalem, flowers, trees, minarets, and the cityscape of Jerusalem. Each element is represented with icon-like reverence as the artist simplified architectural forms with lyricism leaving them to appear as if frozen in time and void of deterioration, in a rather idealised city of memories. Over the years these series grew more simplified and serene. With the devastating events of the war in Lebanon, Husseini moved to abstraction working in collage and layers of script, which appear as palimpests layered with traces of experience and beauty of written language. Her work is held in numerous private collections.
