Ithipol Thangchalok has established an international reputation as both a leading contemporary Thai artist, as well as a respected art educator. While studying at Silpakorn University he was exposed to abstract art and print techniques through Chalood Nimsamer, who had recently returned from the Pratt Graphic Centre in New York. Thangchalok excelled at Silpakorn and subsequently received a scholarship to study fine art at the University of Washington, completing his Masterâ€™s degree in 1975. This was followed by another scholarship to travel to Australia in 1983. 


Thangchalok favours abstraction, his works demonstrating great confidence in managing line and texture. Thangchalok has explored many differing themes in his work as a conceptual artist, including contemporary concerns related to the old and new in urban environments. He has been a regular exhibitor, representing Thailand internationally as well as having a strong local following. He is currently Assistant Professor in Painting at Silpakorn University, and is actively involved in arts organisations in Thailand including the National Gallery, Bangkok. While he has worked with a variety of mediums, he is considered an expert printmaker. He experiments with various printmaking techniques and through his teaching has helped popularise this medium amongst a new generation of Thai artists.
