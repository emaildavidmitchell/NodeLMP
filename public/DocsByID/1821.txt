Smith, (James Marshall) Arthur (1902-1980)

A.J.M. Smith

A.J.M. Smith was a poet, scholar, and anthologist of Canadian literature. As an editor of little magazines and anthologies, Smith was an important figure in the founding of Canadian modernism. 



Born on November 8, 1902 to English parents, Smith grew up in Westmont, Quebec. He studied at McGill University (1921-1926), obtaining a B. Sc. (Arts) and an M.A. His Masters thesis was on the poetry of W.B. Yeats. Smith associated with F.R. Scott, A.M. Kein, Leo Kennedy, and Leon Edel, the circle of Montreal poets who, influenced by T.S. Eliot and Anglo-American modernism, sought to establish the practice of modernist poetry in Canada in order to counter the Victorian-style Confederation Poets of the early twentieth century. 



As an undergraduate student, Smith founded and edited the Literary Supplement of the McGill Daily. He continued his editorial efforts as a graduate student, creating, with Scott in 1925, the McGill Fortnightly Review—the first journal of modernist writing in Canada. The journal helped initiate the tradition of Little Magazines in Canada, publishing the surge of Canadian modernist poetry in the 1920s and 1930s. After marrying Jeanne Dougall Robins in 1927, he began his PhD at University of Edinburgh and completed his dissertation, ‘Studies in the Metaphysical Poets of the Anglican Church in the 17th Century’, in 1931. Smith worked as a professor at Michigan State University (1936-1972).

Smith worked as a professor at Michigan State University (1936-1972).



Smith anonymously co-edited with Kennedy and Scott the first anthology of modernist verse in Canada, New Provinces (1936). Featuring the poetry of Klein, Kennedy, Smith, Scott, E.J. PRATT, and R. FINCH, the anthology announced the arrival of a new generation of poets on the Canadian literary scene. While now seen as an achievement in the development of Canadian modernism, the publication suffered poor sales and the publisher rejected Smith’s modernist manifesto preface. 



American modernist magazines, The Dial, New Verse, and Poetry, regularly published Smith’s poetry, and he was awarded the Harriet Monroe Memorial Prize by Poetry in 1941. Smith established himself as both a poet and a critic in 1943 when he published his first collection of poetry, News of the Phoenix, winner of the Governor General’s Literary Award, and the anthology, The Book of Canadian Poetry. The Book was the first comprehensive collection of Canadian poetry to include modernist poets. In the anthology, Smith distinguishes between two voices—‘native’ and ‘cosmopolitan’—in Canadian literature, characterizing the former as concerned with portraits of Canadian life and the latter as focused on international cultural debates. 



Smith published his last volume of new poetry, A Sort of Ecstasy, in 1954. His prolific critical output and anthologizing projects eclipsed his reputation as a poet, although recent scholarship has begun to re-evaluate his poetry. Smith went on to edit several anthologies, including The Oxford Book of Canadian Verse (1960), a bilingual compendium of Canadian poetry. He died on November 21, 1980 in East Lansing, Michigan. As a prominent scholar of Canadian literature, Smith contributed to the foundation and recognition of a modernist literary tradition in Canada.
