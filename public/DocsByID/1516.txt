Benjamin Péret was a French surrealist poet whose expansive body of work exemplifies the surrealist commitment to adventure, sacrilege, and irrational, marvelous imagery. Born at the turn of the century in Rezé, Péret participated in Paris Dada before joining the surrealist movement. He authored over thirty volumes of poetry, essays, and fiction, and co-edited the first three issues of the journal La Révolution surréaliste, the movement’s mouthpiece during its founding years.

Benjamin Péret was a French surrealist poet whose expansive body of work exemplifies the surrealist commitment to adventure, sacrilege, and irrational, marvellous imagery. Born at the turn of the century in Rezé, Péret participated in Paris Dada before joining the surrealist movement. He authored over thirty volumes of poetry, essays, and fiction, and co-edited the first three issues of the journal La Révolution surréaliste, the movement’s mouthpiece during its founding years. Péret spent years in Brazil and Mexico, contributing to the global reach of French surrealism and drawing inspiration from South American mythology; his publications include an anthology of Mexican folklore and the translation from Spanish of a Mayan epic. Politically radical, Péret fought in the Spanish Civil War, but opposed the harnessing of poetry to any particular political cause. In his 1945 polemic against World War II Resistance poetry, The Poet’s Dishonour, Péret called for the liberation of poetry from religious and patriotic dogma, insisting that the poet’s task is to be a ‘permanent revolutionary’.
