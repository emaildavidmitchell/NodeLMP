Mario Davidovsky is one of the most original and relevant voices in the contemporary music scene and a pioneer in the composition by electronic means. In his celebrated series Synchronisms he explored the interaction and combination possibilities between pre-recorded electronic sound and conventional instruments played live (ranging from a solo instrument to an orchestra and a choir), becoming an inescapable point of reference for composers working with mixed media.



Mario Davidovsky is one of the most original and relevant voices in the contemporary music scene and a pioneer in the composition by electronic means. In his celebrated series Synchronisms he explored the interaction and combination possibilities between pre-recorded electronic sound and conventional instruments played live (ranging from a solo instrument to an orchestra and a choir), becoming an inescapable point of reference for composers working with mixed media.



This series runs through his entire production, which includes both chamber and symphonic and vocal music, and made up of twelve short pieces. The first was composed in 1962 for flute and electronics, and the last in 2006 for clarinet and electronics. Synchronisms number 6 for piano and tape (1970) became a milestone of 20th century music and earned him the 1971 Pulitzer Prize and won him ample renown thanks to its clever integration between electronic means and a conventional instrument.



Davidovsky was born in Médanos, Argentina, and during the fifties he moved to Buenos Aires, where he studied under Guillermo Graetzer, Ernesto Epstein, Erwin Leuchter and Teodoro Fuchs.  He became a member of the Agrupación Nueva Música founded by Juan Carlos Paz.



Before leaving for the United States he premiered his early works amongst which Cuarteto de Cuerdas (String Quartet) (1954), Nonetto for Nine Istruments (1956) and the Suite Sinfónica para “El Payaso” (Symphonic Suite for “The Clown”) (1955) are worth mentioning.



At Aaron Copland’s recommendation in 1958 he arrived at the Berkshire Music Center, known today as Tanglewood. During that period he composed String Quartet nº 2 (1958) and Serie Sinfónica 1959 (Symphonic Series 1959) (1959) in which he continued in the atonal, abstract style of the works he had composed in Buenos Aires.



Contrastes nº 1 (Contrasts nº 2) (1960) for orchestra and electronic sounds inaugurates a new aesthetic characterized by the search for integration of the electronic sound in the musical discourse.  This new impulse coincides with his move to New York, thanks to a suggestion by  Milton Babbit, and where he met Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky at the newly founded Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center.



As well as Professor of Music at Columbia, he became Director of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center from 1981 to 1993. Once there, he began his experiments in electronic music and composed his Electronic Study I, II and III (1961, 1962, 1965), the latter dedicated to Edgard Varèse whose technical assistant he had been as well as eventually his friend. In these studies he applied classical compositional procedures to the electronic generation of sounds with the intention of extending bridges between tradition and the new resources proposed by the emerging technologies of the sixties. Nevertheless when Electronic Study I was presented in a an auditorium, Davidovsky was disatisfied with the absence of a performer and thus he began his systematic search for not only a musical motivation and expression of electronic sounds but also their integration with the Western instrumental tradition, which would come together in his Synchronisms series.  Although he would never give up composing for traditional instruments, after Synchronisms nº 8 (1974) for wind quintet and tape, Davidovsky decided to stop composing electronic music and concentrated fundamentally on instrumental music in which the behavior of the sound in some manner reflected his experience in the studio.  The assimilation of sound manipulation transferred itself to his instrumental writing in his new works and his conception of sound remained attached to electronic music procedures.  The transference of the gestures of that language becomes more evident in Divertimento (1984), Concertante (1990), Duo Capriccioso (2003), Concertino (1995).



Economy and asceticism seem to be the principles that run through the character of his works and a particular focus on texture. According to his own description, a strata created by a polyphonic constellation of statements lead to a linear narrative. His music is also characterized by a lyric warmth and suggestive instrumentation.     

                                          

The composition of his first work for voice, Scenes from Shir ha-Shirim (1975-77) for soprano, two tenors, bass soloist and chamber ensemble, inaugurates his post electronic period. Integrated in three parts (Song of Songs I, II and part of III), a complex politextuality unites with a rhythmic flexibility that brings it closer a Hebrew song. Although there are tonal references, they are elusive.  Harmony is a dense complex that moves between tension and toning down.  His six vocal compositions, with different instrumental accompaniments show Jewish or Hispanic roots (Romancero (1983); Shulamit’s Dream (1993), Sefarad:four Spanish-Ladino Folkscenes (2004)).



The series called Quartetto (1987, 1996, 2000, 2005), the first composed for flute, violin, viola and violoncello, do not depart from entirely from his five string quartets and do not abandon the principle of a dialog between the instruments. But they do introduce in place of the second violin, a flute, an oboe, a piano or a clarinet each of them as a soloist, as would appear in a traditional repertoire.



Although part of his instrumental music follow in traditional genres (suite, chacona, capriccio, concertino, etc.), the manner in which it combines the instruments, his narrative strategies and the way he reinvents the tradition of the instruments are completely innovative.



With Sincronismos 9 (Synchronisms 9) for violin and tape he went back to composition with electronic means.  Even though practically all of Davidovsky’s music requires a high degree of virtuoso performance, this is particularly true for this piece, where different sources of virtuoso writing for violin flow together, probably internalized when he studied the instrument as a boy.



He composed Festino (1994) for guitar, viola, violoncello and bass the same year he began teaching at Harvard, and together with Synchronism nº 10  (1992) are the only works in his Catalog where he uses guitar.



Davidovsky is widely known for his Synchronisms, where he rendered the electronic sounds more aesthetic not only through his ability to endow them with expressive musicality but also because he reintroduced the performer, a disruptive element within the realm of electronic music. He thus gave him/her back to an audience who were reluctant to see loudspeakers in place of live musicians within the new expressive medium.



His music has been recorded by Columbia Records, CRI, New World Records, Wergo, Nonesuch, Finnadar, Turnabout, Bridge Records, DDG, Albany Records and his music publisher by C.F. Peters Corp, E.B. Marks Corp. and Mc Ginnes and Marx.
