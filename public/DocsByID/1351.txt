Born in the popular neighbourhood of Khalifa in Cairo, Egypt, Hamid Nada is
one of the leading figures of Egyptian modern art. He was one of the first
Egyptian painters to introduce symbolism in his work, characterised by the
expression of human inner feelings and inspired by popular traditions. He
joined the Egyptian Group of Contemporary Art founded in 1946 by the
painter and pedagogue Hussein Youssef Amin (1904 -1984), who rejected the
traditional approach of art education and promoted freedom of expression.
In 1948, Nada pursued his studies at the School of Fine Arts in Cairo,
where he graduated in 1951. He studied in Luxor in 1956, and the following
year, he was appointed at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Alexandria. In 1961,
he was named professor at the School of Fine Arts in Cairo and became the
head of its Painting Department in 1977.
