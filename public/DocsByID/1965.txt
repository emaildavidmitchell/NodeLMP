G. M. Trevelyan was a British historian and the great-nephew of another famous British historian and politician, Thomas Babington Macaulay. Trevelyan was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he later became a lecturer and regius professor of modern history. He was ultimately appointed Master, a position he held from 1940 until 1951. Trevelyan served in World War I as a commanding officer of the first British Red Cross ambulance unit sent to Italy, culminating in his decoration by the Italian government. Having written in the style of his great uncle, Trevelyan was one of the last great Whig historians.

Trevelyan served in World War I as a commanding officer of the first British Red Cross ambulance unit sent to Italy, culminating in his decoration by the Italian government. Having written in the style of his great uncle, Trevelyan was one of the last great Whig historians. His writing reflects an understanding of history as following a trajectory of evolutionary progressâ€”a teleological interpretation with the end goals of liberty and constitutional government. His most well-known histories include: the Garibaldi trilogy (1907-1911); History of England (1926); the trilogy England under Queen Anne (1930-1934); The English Revolution, 1688-1698 (1938); and English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries: Chaucer to Queen Victoria (1942 in the United States and Canada; 1944 in the United Kingdom). In addition to his scholarship, Trevelyan wrote on the subject of rural preservation, most actively during the late 1920s and early 1930s. A series of lectures was founded in his honor at Cambridge in 1958, four years before his death on July 20, 1962.
