Philippe Soupault was born in Chaville, France, on August 2, 1897, and died
in Paris on March 12, 1990, aged 93. He cofounded the surrealist movement
with Andr Breton and Louis Aragon, after the Dada movement. With Breton,
he wrote the first automatic text, Les Champs magntiques [Magnetic
Fields]. His poetry is more easily assimilated and understood than that of
other surrealists, prime examples being Westwego: 1917-1922, and Georgia,
of 1926. In World War II, he was imprisoned by the Nazis, and, under the
government of Charles de Gaulle, he was sent in 1943, on a mission to the
United States and South and Central America, to work with the French press.
A sociable and sophisticated man, he was associated in New York with the
photographer Man Ray, the architect Marcel Breuer, the painter Fernand
Lger, and the composer Kurt Weill. He traveled widely, meeting the
photographer Gisle Freund and the writer Victoria Ocampo in Argentina.
As well as poetry, he wrote novels, plays, and essays. Among his better
known works is the classic Les Dernires Nuits de Paris [The Last Nights of
Paris] of 1926, translated by William Carlos Williams.
