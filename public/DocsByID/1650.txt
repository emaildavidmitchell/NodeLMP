Glauber Rocha
Peter Baker (Texas A & M University)
Glauber Rocha de Andrade (Vitria da Conquista, 1939 - 1981) was a
Brazilian film critic, screenwriter, producer and director. Arguably the
most important director of the cinema nvo (New Cinema) movement of the
1960s and 1970s, he began his career as a film critic, writing for well-
known Brazilian journals about Italian neorealism and the French New
Wavetwo crucial influences on his own work. His writings criticised
Brazil's commercial cinema and called for a new type of film that would
represent the reality of Brazilian life. His most famous essay in this
regard is Esttica da Fome (An Esthetic of Hunger, 1965). The essay
reflects on the neo-colonial condition of Brazilian cinema through the
analogy of the starvation of the Brazilian people and the intellectual
starvation of its cinematic tradition; anti-colonial revolutionary violence
is the only possible solution to these plights. This theoretical viewpoint
is reflected in his  Deu e o Diabo na Terra do Sol (Black God, White Devil,
1964), a film which earned him recognition on the international scene and
in Brazil as the unchallenged leader of a new generation. Rocha continued
to define the cinema nvo movement with his filmic production throughout
his life, but increased repression and censorship under Brazil's military
dictatorship after 1964 made the criticism encoded in his films
increasingly indirect. Many were produced abroad and in 1971 Rocha went
into voluntary exile. Rocha was a determining influence on Brazilian cinema
and a generative figure in the development of what came to be called Third
Cinemas.
