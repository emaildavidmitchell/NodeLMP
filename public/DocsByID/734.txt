Arshile Gorky was an Armenian American artist whose work and knowledge of European avant-garde art contributed to the development of Abstract Expressionism. Born Vosdanig Adoian in Khorkom, Armenia, Gorky immigrated to the United States in 1920, changed his name and established himself as a self-taught painter in New York City. In the 1940s, Gorky developed an individual, expressive style characterized by colourful biomorphic shapes, sinuous lines and gestural brushstrokes inspired by the surrealist technique of Automatism. His astute understanding of abstract pictorial structure, the result of intensive study of artists such as Paul Cezanne, Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso, resulted in balanced and grounded compositions. The artist’s life experiences provided powerful content for his paintings, especially his childhood memories of Armenia. Common themes in Gorky’s art and biography include nostalgia and tragedy, the latter often linked to the untimely death of his mother in 1919 and a series of grievous events during the late 1940s that culminated in the artist’s suicide on 21 July 1948.
