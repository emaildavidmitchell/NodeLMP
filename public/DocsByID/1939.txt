(Note that the short bio next to Keun’s picture actually contains some factual errors. Copyright seems not to apply to this image from what I can tell. I’ve gone through the various books that include documents and images of Keun, and this is listed as coming from Marjorie Strauss, the wife of Keun’s ex-lover Arnold Strauss.)

(All I know about Tergit’s papers is that she left them to the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach.)
