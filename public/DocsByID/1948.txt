Tippett, Sir Michael (1905-1998)

Tippett, Sir Michael (Kemp)

Michael Tippett was one of the leading British composers of the twentieth century. His music and his writings are characterised by an enduring commitment to humanist values and traditions, mediated by an increasingly ironic and critically self-aware modern subjectivity. 



Born into a relatively affluent middle-class family from rural Suffolk, Tippett’s environment at home and at boarding school cultivated his life-long intellectual curiosity and independence, but provided him with a patchy musical education. Adamant that he would be a composer nevertheless, he enrolled twice at the Royal College of Music where he painstakingly sought to develop both compositional technique and a heightened awareness of the Western classical musical tradition. 



The experience of the global economic depression in the first half of the 1930s, heightened by working with unemployed musicians and providing musical opportunities at North Yorkshire work camps, politicised Tippett’s nascent left-wing sensibilities, though a brief spell in the British Communist party ended due to the incompatibility of his Trotskyist orientation with prevailing Stalinist thought. A more lasting commitment came through his pacifism, for which he was jailed in 1943; having joined the Peace Pledge Union in 1940, he went on to serve on its council in the 1950s and was Honorary President from 1958 until his death.

The end of a six-year relationship with the painter Wilfred Franks prompted a course of Jungian analysis, through which Tippett came to the conclusion that music could provide a corrective to the psychological and spiritual ruptures of modernity. This, in conjunction with concurrent conversations about the nature of art with T. S. Eliot, who Tippett was later to describe as an ‘artistic mentor,’ (Tippett 109) resulted in the oratorio A Child of Our Time (1939-41). The subject of the oratorio is ostensibly the assassination of the German diplomat Ernst von Rath by the Polish Jew Herschel Grynzpan in 1938, and the subsequent pogrom in Germany (the Kristallnacht), though the underlying argument centres on the potentially catastrophic consequences of the lack of (Jungian) self-knowledge. The work reflects the influence of Eliot in its multiple stylistic, musical and literary allusions and quotations; the use of negro spirituals to universalise the underlying message of the work is not without controversy.



Tippett continued to explore the musical and philosophical implications of the oratorio in works both non-texted (String Quartet No. 2 (1941-42), Symphony No. 1 (1944-45)) and texted. The Midsummer Marriage (1946-52) offers an extended allegory of the Jungian process of individuation, offering a wider frame of reference and an altogether more positive conclusion than any work of Tippett’s at that time, and concerns far from those of his contemporaries.



Reflecting on the changing ‘feel of our time’ (Kemp 323) in the 1950s, Tippett’s music began to evince a shift in sensibilities from the bracing yet affirmative qualities offered as a corrective to the war years to a stance that rejected the increasing faith in scientific rationalism. The Symphony No. 2 (1956-57) is, on the surface, an invigorating reappraisal of the symphonic genre in the light of Stravinskian neo-classicism; yet it is musically poised between the hard-won tonal and textural richness of Tippett’s earlier music and the music of the coming decades. By the early 1960s, and in the opera King Priam (1958-61), this process came to fruition with an apparent change of style from rich lyricism and driving rhythms to a fragmented, rebarbative language that seemed to owe much to late Stravinsky and the new music being written in continental Europe. In a string of works in the 1960s and early 1970s, Tippett’s music is characterised by the presentation of a fragmented subjectivity that nevertheless strives for some measure of reconciliation, as in The Vision Of Saint Augustine for baritone solo, chorus and orchestra (1963-65), the opera The Knot Garden (1966-69), Songs For Dov for tenor and small orchestra (1969-70) and the Symphony No. 3 (1970-72). The latter three works in particular foreground the use of musical quotations, complementing the use of literary quotations that had been a feature of Tippett’s self-penned libretti from the outset.



Tippett’s penchant for lyricism, mostly suppressed during the 1960s, returns as a counterbalance to the more abrasive material, as in the Triple Concerto For Violin, Viola, Cello And Orchestra (1978-79) and The Rose Lake (1991-93). At the same time the questioning of certainties — philosophical, artistic, scientific and musical — continues to colour his later music. The Symphony No. 3 offers a critique of the humanist message of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, and in The Mask Of Time (1980-82) Tippett explores mankind’s continued and ultimately unsuccessful attempts to comprehend the world through artistic, religious, and scientific means. In both cases, and in the operas The Ice Break (1973-76) and New Year (1985-88), affirmation and hope is counterbalanced by ironic undercutting that questions both the possibilities of such states as well as the ability of art to effect meaningful spiritual transformations.
