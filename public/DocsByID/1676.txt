RUSSIAN MODERNISM (1890-1934)
Russian modernism arose as a rejection of positivism and the realism of the
major nineteenth-century Russian novelists such as Lev Tolstoy, Fyodor
Dostoevsky, and Ivan Turgenev. In its first phase it was marked by a
rekindled interest in poetry, mysticism and symbolism. There was also a
tendency to seek a fusion of different forms of artistic expression:
poetry, music, painting and theatre.  Playwrights reflected the move away
from naturalism towards the theatricality of commedia dellarte and
metadrama (the play within the play). In prose there emerged a new
decorative style and new themes such as sexuality. The Russian Revolution
of 1917 signalled an important shift towards the avant-garde. Poets adopted
radical new poetic forms, glorified the new machine age or hearkened back
to the pre-historical roots myth and experimented with invented, abstract
language. Prose writers shifted towards a stark new factual style that
incorporated documents and slogans. Their themes were the revolutionary
changes in Russia and their own inadequacy in the face of the new Soviet
man. The avant-garde received its death-blow with the promulgation of
socialist realism as the mandatory style for all publishing authors at the
All-Union Writers Conference in 1934.
DEFINITION
The term modernism has only become current in Russia since the end of the
USSR; previously, the term was Decadentism, reflecting the Socialist
Realist interpretation of literary history, which was enforced inside the
Soviet Union as of 1934. Emigr criticism used the term Silver Age to
describe the work of the first generation of modernist Russian poets. In
present-day Russian parlance the term modernism is generally used to denote
the period in the evolution of literary art between the dominant realist
narrative mode of the nineteenth century and the avant-garde of the 1910s
and 20s.  In this article the term modernism is used as an internationally
accepted umbrella term for the work of Symbolist, Futurist, Acmeist and
other avant-garde poets, playwrights and prose-writers appearing in the
years between about 1890 and 1934.
SYMBOLISM
The earliest manifestation of modernism in Russian literature can be found
in the works of Dmitry Merezhkovsky (1865-1941). Merezhkovsky rejected the
vulgar utilitarian realism of the preceding generation of Russian writers
and bewailed the mediocrity of contemporary literary standards. He proposed
a new art based on mysticism and the symbol. His own poetry was imbued with
a fin-de-sicle pessimism. His religious aspirations were inspired by the
writings of Dostoevsky and Vladimir Soloviev (1853-1900), who rejected
positivism and proposed a new, mystical renewal of Christianity.
Merezhkovsky and his wife, the poet Zinaida Gippius ,(1869-1945) were
active in the search for a New Church and organised Religious-
Philosophical Meetings where among other things the ideas of a Godman,
originally proposed by Soloviev were discussed. The first generation of
Symbolist poets, including such major figures as Konstantin Balmont (1867-
1942) and Valery Briusov (1873-1924), were strongly influenced by the
French Symbolists, especially Baudelaire, Verlaine, and Mallarm, who began
to be translated in the 1890s. Russian Symbolist poetry was characterized
by a preoccupation with new poetic forms; themes of loneliness and
pessimism dominated, as well as a mystical belief in an ideal other world
summed up in the phrase a realibus ad realiora (from reality to the more
real, Latin).
      These themes were developed further in the poetry of the younger
Symbolist Alexander Blok (1880-1921), which evoked the theme of a feminine
ideal, expressed in the title of his first collection of poems Poems About
the Beautiful Lady (1904). In what is the most famous poem of Russian
Symbolism The Stranger (1906) the woman appears to the poet as he drinks
in a tavern. In Bloks poetry the religious mysticism and pessimism began
to acquire apocalyptic tones as the poet sensed the coming disasters of the
twentieth century. This note was perhaps best expressed in the line We are
the children of Russias terrible years from a 1914 poem. Russian
Symbolism is represented by a whole pleiad of other first-rate poets,
including Fyodor Sologub (1863-1927), Andrei Bely (1880-1934), and
Vyacheslav Ivanov (1866-1949). The Symbolist period in Russia in
represented by several important journals, which published original
literary and critical works. The most important of these was the literary
journal The Scales (1904-1909) and World of Art (1898-1904), which was a
general cultural journal.
      It was during the Symbolist period that another characteristic of
Russian modernism became apparent, namely syncretism, or the tendency of
various strands of artistic expression to come together  poetry, painting,
music, and theatre, in the spirit of Richard Wagners Gesamtkunstwerk
(German: total work of art). Russian proponents of syncretism included
the composer Aleksandr Scriabin (1872-1915) and painter Vassily Kandinsky
(1866-1944). An example of syncretism is the 1906 production by Vsevolod
Meyerhold (1974-1940) of Bloks short play The Showbooth, in which
Meyerhold himself played the principal role of Pierrot. The decorations
were by Nikolay Sapunov (1880-1912) and music by Mikhail Kuzmin (1875-
1936). If, however, Wagner and his Russian followers sought a mystical
unity between stage and audience, Meyerholds production evoked a scandal
equalled only by the first staging by the Ballets Russes in Paris in 1913
of Le Sacre du Printemps (The Rite of Spring) by Igor Stravinsky (1882-
1971). Inspired by the Italian comedy of masks, the playwrights Kuzmin and
Nikolay Evreinov (1879-1953) experimented with play-within-a-play texts.
Evreinov espoused the idea of the world as theatre, and his play The Main
Thing (1921) can be compared to Luigi Pirandellos Sei Personaggi in Cerca
DAutore (Six Characters in Search of an Author, 1920).
      By about 1910 Symbolism began to be surpassed by a new generation of
poets, principally Nikolay Gumilev (1886-1921), Anna Akhmatov, 1889-1966)
and Osip Mandelstam (1891-1938), who, inspired by the older poet Innokenty
Annensky (1855-1909), focussed on the realia of life and espoused a clarity
of expression and form in their work, which they called Acmeism. Blok and
Briusov joined the Bolsheviks after the 1917 revolution. Blok wrote a
haunting evocation of revolutionary Petrograd in his poem The Twelve
(1918) in which twelve Bolshevik sailors patrol in a blizzard accompanied
by a hungry dog and preceded by Jesus Christ. After the revolution many of
the Symbolists emigrated; Symbolist and Acmeist tendencies were continued
outside Russia in the poetry of Vladislav Khodasevich (1886-1939) and
Georgy Ivanov (1894-1958), who produced his best work there.
THE AVANT-GARDE
From about 1910 the Futurists Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893-1930) and Velimir
Khlebnikov (1885-1922) initiated a radical break with Symbolism and
Acmeism, experimenting with new forms of expression and, in the case of
Khlebnikov, a new abstract, trans-sense language. Sometimes called cubo-
futurism this movement was Janus-faced, looking forward to the excitement
of cities and the machine age, and backwards to a primitive, pre-historic
past. If the Symbolists had defiantly labelled themselves as decadents
and rejected the idea of social usefulness in favour of ideal aesthetics,
the avant-garde openly welcomed the coming destruction of the old world and
envisioned a new utopia. If the Symbolists had sought a renewal of poetic
form, the avant-gardes work was characterised by dissonance, isolation of
objects from their context, and a rejection of narrative continuity.
      In the 1910s Boris Pasternak (1890-1960) and Marina Tsvetaeva (1892-
1941), in their individual ways, also emerged as major poets, Pasternak
privileging metonymy over metaphor, as the linguist Roman Jakobson pointed
out, while Tsvetaeva pushed the expressiveness of language and rhyme to the
extreme. The two poets, who corresponded regularly, attempted to stand
aside from the cataclysmic events in Russia, a stance summarized in a line
from Pasternaks poem My Sister Life: What millennium is it outside?
Tsvetaeva emigrated to France in 1922, where she suffered from isolation
from the migr community. In 1939 she returned to Russia and committed
suicide in 1941. Pasternak remained in the Soviet Union throughout his
life, although threats were made to revoke his citizenship following the
Nobel Prize scandal of 1958, when Pasternak first accepted and then refused
the prize. Coming on the heels of the illegal publication of his novel
Doctor Zhivago by numerous foreign publishing houses, the award of the
Nobel Prize and Pasternaks coerced refusal of the honour was a huge
embarrassment for the Party leadership.
      The avant-garde tendency in Russian art, of which the Futurists were
the poetic harbingers, straddled the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. Apart
from poetry it encompassed Meyerholds constructivist theatre productions;
the artists Kazimir Malevich, Mikhail Larionov and Vladimir Tatlin
underwent a rapid evolution from Cubism through Rayonnism to abstract forms
in painting, photography, cinema, and even architecture. If the Cubist art
of the 1910s had had as its core procedure the presentation of an object
from diverse perspectives, in the 1920s it is the collage principle - the
juxtaposition of observed or found fragments  that dominated, whether in
the photo-collages of Alexander Rodchenko, the new techniques of cinematic
montage of Vsevolod Pudovkin, Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov or, as
Patricia Carden has shown, in the prose of Isaac Babel (1894-1940).
MODERNIST PROSE
Due to the enduring popularity of naturalist prose, Russian modernist
prose, in the early years, took a back seat to poetry and theatre.  The
novels of Alexei Remizov (1877-1957) showed a tendency to ornamentalism and
delved into the roots of Russian folklore and medieval storytelling.  The
first truly Modernist novel was Petersburg (1916) by Andrei Bely, which
deployed new forms of expression and poetic prose and has been compared to
Joyces Ulysses. Prose in the 1920s was, on the one hand, inspired by the
avant-garde tendency towards documentary and factography  the pasting
together of found texts - and by the technique of skaz, a mimicking of the
common speech. The novel The Naked Year (1922) by Boris Pilnyak (1894-1938)
combines these techniques; moreover, it renounces both a strong plot line
and central characters. Babels short-story cycle Red Cavalry (1926) also
uses montage techniques and skaz (the imitation of oral speech), but at the
same time introduces and problematizes the role of the intellectual in
revolutionary Russia. His other works include the cycle Odessa Stories
(1931) about Jewish life in Odessa, and two plays, Sunset (1927) and Maria
(1935). Yury Olesha (1899-1960) developed further the topic of individual
inadequacy in the face of the new revolutionary man in his novel Envy
(1927). In the 1920s the poets Mandelstam and Pasternak both published
prose works. Konstantin Vaginov (1899-1934), author of Goat Song (1927)
began writing poetic prose that can be compared to that of James Joyce in
its ironic attention to everyday detail. The ultimate culmination of this
line of development is the prose of Andrei Platonov (1899-1951), which
subtly reflects official jargon and the hapless clichs of Russians left
behind by the changes in their country.
      As the 1920s progressed the political situation became increasingly
hostile to the avant-garde. Mayakovskys suicide in 1930 was a harbinger of
things to come.  The promulgation of Socialist Realism at the All-Union
Writers Conference in 1934 marked a definitive end to modernism in all
forms of art, although Boris Groys has argued that socialist realism is a
logical outgrowth of the avant-garde. Russian modernist artists were
dispersed and in many cases (Babel, Meyerhold, Mandelstam) physically
liquidated. Two of the survivors, however, produced important late examples
of modernist writing: Anna Akhmatovas Poem Without a Hero and Boris
Pasternaks Doctor Zhivago, both begun in the 1940s but published only much
later. Modernisms achievements also lived on to a considerable extent in
the Russian novels of the migr Vladimir Nabokov (1899-1977), notably
Invitation to a Beheading (1935). It is only since the fall of Communism
that many of the artists and works mentioned above have received full
recognition in their homeland. Some critics have seen Russian
postmodernism, which appeared in the 1980s, as in part an extension of the
interrupted modernist aesthetic.
