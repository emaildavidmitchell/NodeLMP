The East West Dance Encounter 1984 Bombay, consisted of a week of presentations and discussion among selected performers and critics representing a range of styles, forms, and theories of dance and committed to inter-cultural exchange. In the evenings were public performances. Despite a long history of transformation, Indian dance in the 1980s was known more for adherence to tradition than for innovation. The East West Dance Encounter represented an early effort to acknowledge and celebrate choreographic experimentation. It highlighted projects that contended with the demands of a recently reformed tradition and those that engaged with modernist aesthetics, including expressionism and minimalism alongside postmodern initiatives like parody. This event set the stage for subsequent Dance Encounter events that continued to support modernist work in India.

Contribution to Modernism

The East-West Encounters were conceived by Dr. Georg Lechner, sponsored by The Max Mueller Bhavan, and hosted at The National Center for Performing Arts, which at that time was a complex of workspaces and theatres for various arts. From a present-day perspective, the title of this event evokes binaries and essentialised thinking, despite its attempt to include multiple perspectives, including that of colonials talking back. Yet, this event marked a watershed in the approach of audiences and the governmental official approach to dance. Until this time, primarily the classical dance forms were exported as examples of an ancient and complex Indian culture. There was only one government-owned television channel and punitive import duties on all electronic equipment. News in different languages, and local theatre and dance productions were broadcast from videotapes that were erased and reused. So visibility and longevity in artistic careers were predominantly contingent on state recognition- Since the 1991 ‘liberalisation’ of the Indian economy, the introduction of cable with multiple channels and the internet, public choice, local and international corporate sponsors have determined content. With that, the bodily representations in Indian film have become internationalized. In Indian television channels today, dance competitions have proliferated, and innovative moves are celebrated. In art dance, the classicists are now choreographers, and the moderns continue to educate their audiences.



B. Malchow-Tayebi, in 1984 wrote:

What really took place was a meeting of extraordinary human beings and artists…Confrontation and companionship were not determined by forms and techniques of their different dance styles, but by the differing motivations and driving forces behind the creative process. … Vulnerability, anxiety, uncertainty, and failure no longer remained feelings to be hidden. Honesty, compassion and love no longer seemed an impossible dream. (65)



It was here that a new community of dancers committed to exploring New Directions came to coalesce, where Chandralekha was first recognised as the explosive, passionate icon for change that she was; where Kumudini Lakhia’s call to contemporize the content of Kathak was cheered; where Sonal Mansingh eloquently resisted pressures to depict the terrors of the holocaust and said clearly ‘I want to make Pools of light;’ where Igor Wakhevitch and I ventured into unknown territory of exploring cosmic Time, and the safer space of shape transformations of bharatanatyam adavus; Astad Deboo regaled the audience with his satire of Bollywood. 



From the literature produced by Dr. Georg Lechner after the event, one adduces that the western dancers were presented as examples to be emulated. This was resisted by many dancers present adding to the turmoil of that week. Lechner scathingly castigated Bombay audiences and the press for their responses to the performances. ‘Dear audience’ he wrote, ‘study the art of fishing and cast the right net…’ In defence of the performances of Gerhard Bohner and other western dancers, whose work the Bombay audience had apparently found incomprehensible, he launched on a historical summary of the changes in dance in Europe (particularly Germany) with references to the USA. Indian dance (he explained) was still mired in ‘a solid pact between dancer, guru and rasika (knowledgeable member of the audience,) guided by age-honoured set rules…codification, sublimation…’ Of the Indian dancers, he lauded Chandralekha, ignoring all others but Deboo and myself, who served as fodder for his angst. On Carmen DeLavallade’s exquisite and beloved performance, he reserved judgment- somewhat patronizingly.  Georg Lechner went on to organize several follow up Dance Encounters in India in the following years. The high profile 10th anniversary in 1993 was renamed New Directions in Indian dance, and encountered a hostile press in Delhi where it was held. 



Some ‘Western’ dancers, sensitive to the colonial implications of their presence but eager to fulfil their obligations to the East, offered gentle mentorship. The legacy of this exchange continued for many years as a dialogue between Susanne Linke, Pina Bausch and Chandralekha, and as lifelong dialogues for others. Chris Lechner, former dancer at the Stuttgart Ballet, and Georg’s son, still works with Indian contemporary dancers. Most importantly the event legitimized innovation for dancers from and within India. (Previously, only non-Indian dancers were expected to innovate beyond tradition.) Also, the gatekeeping notion of authenticity -- which had hitherto meant a demand for unchanged tradition -- was recast as a demand for individual artistic integrity.  This watershed event officially opened the door for new choreographies not only in modernist and post traditional choreographies, but also within the classical forms.
