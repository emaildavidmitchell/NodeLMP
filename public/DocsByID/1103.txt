Lawson, John Howard (1894-1977)

John Howard Lawson was born in New York City on 25 September 1894. His
first major play, Roger Bloomer (1923), advanced expressionism in the
United States, trading the pessimism that frequently defined the form for
optimism. Processional (1925), produced by the Theatre Guild, was also
formally adventurous. Combining jazz, vaudeville, and dada, and focusing on
a labor dispute, it is Lawsons masterwork.

Nirvana (1926), Loudspeaker (1927), and The International (1928) followed.
The latter two were produced by the New Playwrights Theatre, a group
Lawson co-founded that sought a working-class audience. Loudspeaker,
drawing on constructivism, lampoons American politics and big business; The
International imagines a future war through juxtaposition of realism,
dance, and choral odes. The New Playwrights folded in 1929.

Lawson spent most of the early 1930s in Hollywood. He briefly revisited the
theatre with Success Story (1932), his first foray into realism and
produced by the Group Theatre. In 1933 he became involved in the Screen
Writers Guild, eventually serving as president. In 1934, he had concurrent
New York productions with The Pure in Heart and Gentlewoman. The former
draws on the avant-garde; the latter relies on realism.

After joining the Communist Party, Lawson spent the latter years of the
1930s immersed in various left-wing causes and writing The Theory and
Technique of Playwriting (1936). His theatrical career concluded with
Marching Song (1937), a social realist rendering of an automotive plant
strike.

Returning to Hollywood, Lawson spent the next decade writing screenplays
and holding leadership positions in the Communist Party. In 1947 he was one
of the Hollywood Ten, a group comprised of individuals from the film
industry who were purported Communists or sympathetic to revolutionary
causes. Lawson testified before House Un-American Activities Committee
(HUAC). Cited for contempt, he spent two years in federal prison. His
principal writings that followed were Marxist critical studies of United
States culture. He died in San Francisco on 11 August 1977.
