Osanai, Kaoru (1881–1928)

小山内　薫

Osanai Kaoru was a central figure in the development of both naturalist and modernist theatre in Japan, and he is best known for his work as a director, critic, translator, and playwright. In 1909, Osanai and kabuki actor Ichikawa Sadanji (1880–1940) founded the jiyūgekijō (自由劇場 Free Theatre), a theatre company devoted to introducing translated Western texts to Japan. For the Free Theatre’s inaugural performance in that same year, Osanai directed a Japanese language production of John Gabriel Borkman (1896) by Henrik Ibsen (1828–1906). This naturalistic production is frequently considered to be the first performance in the Japanese theatrical genre known as shingeki (新劇New Theatre). The Free Theatre continued to stage both Western plays in translation and also some new plays by Japanese playwrights until it dissolved due to financial difficulties in 1919. In 1924, Osanai joined with former pupil Hijikata Yoshi (1898–1959) to build the Tsukiji Little Theater and also to create a theater company of the same name. In addition to naturalist plays, the Tsukiji Little Theater staged German expressionist productions and, later, modernized kabuki classics with an emphasis on spectacle and mass appeal. Osanai also produced and starred in the silent film Souls on the Road (1921) and wrote Japan’s first radio play, ‘In the Mines’ (1925).

In 1909, Osanai and kabuki actor Ichikawa Sadanji (1880–1940) founded the jiyūgekijō (自由劇場 Free Theatre), a theatre company devoted to introducing translated Western texts to Japan. For the Free Theatre’s inaugural performance in that same year, Osanai directed a Japanese language production of John Gabriel Borkman (1896) by Henrik Ibsen (1828–1906). This naturalistic production is frequently considered to be the first performance in the Japanese theatrical genre known as shingeki (新劇New Theatre). The Free Theatre continued to stage both Western plays in translation and also some new plays by Japanese playwrights until it dissolved due to financial difficulties in 1919. In 1924, Osanai joined with former pupil Hijikata Yoshi (1898–1959) to build the Tsukiji Little Theater and also to create a theater company of the same name. In addition to naturalist plays, the Tsukiji Little Theater staged German expressionist productions and, later, modernized kabuki classics with an emphasis on spectacle and mass appeal. Osanai also produced and starred in the silent film Souls on the Road (1921) and wrote Japan’s first radio play, ‘In the Mines’ (1925). 



Osanai was a practical reformer and an intellectual leader during an era of rapid change in Japanese theater, and his conception of what New Theater should be shifted over time. He writings do not provide a systematic and consistent statement of what New Theatre should be. As such, defining what the New Theater was for Osanai is a subject of controversy, both during his lifetime and in the field of Japanese theater history.



One consistent feature of Osanai’s definition of New Theater was that it should be neither kabuki nor shinpa (新派). Shinpa a was melodramatic and often political genre of theater from the late nineteenth century that staged modern plays from Japan and adaptations of Western classics, but its language and performance conventions retained strong ties to traditional kabuki. However, even though Osanai defined New Theater in opposition to kabuki and shinpa, he continued to have a complicated relationship with both forms. Osanai was himself a former shinpa professional. In 1904, five years before founding the Free Theater, he took a job writing shinpa adaptations of Western dramatic texts at Ii Yōhō’s (1871–1932) Masagoza theater. Additionally, unlike his contemporary New Theater rival Tsubouchi Shōyō (1859–1953), who trained amateurs to act in a new naturalistic style, Osanai’s goal as stated in his ‘Plan for the Free Theater’ (1909) was to turn professional actors from kabuki and shinpa into amateurs for the New Theater’s naturalistic productions. 



At the time Osanai founded the Free Theater, he conceived of New Theater as a theatrical genre that focused primarily on translating foreign language dramatic texts into Japanese and performing those dramatic texts in a style derived from Western theatrical naturalism. In this way, the New Theater of Osanai’s early Free Theater was largely an extension of the naturalist literary movement in Japan. However, after seeing productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski (1863–1938) and Gordon Craig (1872–1966) during a trip to Russia and Europe in the years 1912 and 1913, Osanai began to instead advocate for theater as an independent art, separate from dramatic literature. In Osanai’s ‘A Message Regarding ‘The Free Theater’’ (1913), he suggested that his previous plays had been nothing more than introductions to literary texts, not theater as an art form in its own right. Osanai’s advocacy for New Theater to become an independent art form is in line with a global shift in the early twentieth-century modern theater away from the centrality of a dramatic text and toward a director’s unifying dramatic vision. This shift is also expressed in, for example, Gordon Craig’s ‘The Actor and the Über-Marionette’ (1908), a text that helped shape Osanai’s conception of theater. 



Although both Osanai and New Theater are often discussed as the movement that introduced naturalist and realist theater to Japan, Osanai’s Free Theater and the Tsukiji Little Theater also played a significant role in introducing non-realist and non-naturalist works. In his 1921–1922 ‘Little Theaters and Big Theaters’, Osanai made his anti-realist stance clear:



From the perspective of the global art movement, realism has already been excommunicated. It is in exile. In the worlds of painting, sculpture, literature, and theater, you certainly no longer see realism among the works of the highest quality. This is of course true for music and dance as well. In Japan, it appears that pitiful playwrights of the likes of Kikuchi Kan [1888–1948], who still think that dramatic texts must be realist, who still think that the theatre must be realist, continue to occupy a position of great stature. However, even before the Great War [World War I], a new wind had begun to stir. This wind risked its life to escape from horrific fires of war that we in Japan could not even begin to imagine. As soon as the war ended, this wind whipped its way through all of Europe. I believe that, in the near future, this whirlwind of the new art movement will certainly destroy Japanese realism (which is nothing but an aspect of bourgeois literature).  



Even before this provocative statement, Osanai’s Free Theater staged symbolist dramas, such as a 1912 production of Maurice Maeterlinck’s (1862–1949) The Death of Tintagiles (1894), translated by Osanai himself. Later, the Tsukiji Little Theater’s inaugural performance in 1924 featured Reinhard Goering’s (1887–1936) expressionist work Naval Encounter (Seeschlacht, 1917), and Osanai wrote pieces like ‘Research into Expressionist Dramatic Texts’ in order to introduce German expressionist theatre to Japan.



In a 1927 lecture on ‘The Future of Japanese Theatre’, Osanai expressed interest in drawing on not only Japan’s kabuki tradition but also theatre practices from Asian countries including China and India. This turn to Asia to inspire modern theatre was again in synch with global modernist trends in theatre, shared by contemporaries like Vsevolod Meyerhold (1874–1940). In 1928, Osanai pursued his boundary crossing fusion of modernist and classical theatre when he scripted a modernized adaptation of Chikamatsu Monzaemon’s (1653–1725) The Battles of Coxinaga (1715), which was performed at the Tsukiji Little Theatre just two months before his premature death.
