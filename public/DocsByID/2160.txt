ZABOLOTSKY, Nikolai Alexeevich (,  ) (1903-
1958)

Nikolai Alexeevich Zabolotsky was a Russian poet and translator, and a
member of the avant-garde absurdist group Oberiu (a modified acronym for
Obedinenie Realnogo Iskusstva [Association for Real Art)]). He was born in
Kizicheskaya sloboda on May 7, 1903, and died in Moscow on October 14,
1958.  Zabolotsky is best known for his work with the late avant-garde,
alongside Daniil Kharms and Alexander Vvedensky in their absurdist group,
Oberiu. In 1920 Zabolotsky moved away from his family in Urzhum to Moscow
to study medicine and philology at Moscow University. Only a year later he
moved to Petrograd and enrolled in the Pedagogical Institute of St.
Petersburg State University. After graduating in 1925, Zabolotsky met
Kharms and Vvedensky at a poetry reading and in 1928 they formed Oberiu, a
group which gained notoriety for their nonsensical verse and absurdist
theatrical productions. By 1931 Oberius activity began to decline under
the pressure of the Stalinist purges and the officially sanctioned
Socialist Realism. In 1938 Zabolotsky was arrested in one of Stalins
purges for his anti-Leninist philosophic views and sent to Siberia. He
spent much of his time in Siberia working on his translation of the Kievian
Rus epic, The Lay of Igors Host. Twelve years later he was released, and
he moved to Moscow where he spent the remainder of his life writing
translations and poetry.
