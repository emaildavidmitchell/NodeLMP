Younan, Ramses (1913-1966)



Born to a humble family in Minieh, Egypt, Younan enrolled at the School of Fine Arts in Cairo in 1929, but dropped out in 1933 before finishing his diploma. This was due to an irreconcilable gap in creative and intellectual affinities that he perceived between himself and his peers and instructors. In 1934 after obtaining a teaching certificate from the Syndicate of Higher Education, he took up a job as an art teacher in a number of public schools in Tantah, Port-Said and Cairo. In 1935, he joined “The Call for Art Group” founded by Habib Girji which advocated the importance of Art in education amongst children. In 1939, he was one of the co-signatories of the manifesto “Long Live Degenerate Art” signed by 37 mostly but not exclusively Egyptian artists and intellectuals living in Cairo at the time condemning the persecution of artists in Europe by the Nazis and the Fascists. In 1939, he co-founded with Geroges Henein, the Art and Liberty Group that comprised of a number of intellectuals and artists who aligned themselves primarily with Surrealism. In 1941, Younan quit teaching to devote himself entirely to art and writing.  He became the editor-in-chief of the leftist weekly Magazine “Al-Majalla Al-Jadida” (The New Magazine). He left Egypt for Paris in 1947 and worked in the Arabic Department of the French National Radio until 1956 while always working as a painter and writer. After a brief time spent in the press office of the Egyptian Embassy in Paris, he returned to Cairo where he stayed until his death in 1966.
