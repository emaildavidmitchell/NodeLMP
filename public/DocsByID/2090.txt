Orson Welles (1915-1985)
Luis Miguel Garca Mainar (University of Zaragoza)

Orson Welles was born on May 6, 1915 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to Richard Head
Welles, a prosperous wagon manufacturer and inventor, and Beatrice Ives
Welles, a gifted concert pianist. Noted for a deep resonant voice, imposing
personality and overflowing talent, he was an actor, director, writer and
producer in theatre, radio and film. Welles succeeded in innovating in all
those fields but left his mark mostly on cinema with a series of
stylistically original films. His Citizen Kane recounted the life of
newspaper mogul Charles Foster Kane, fashioned after media magnate William
Randolph Hearst, from five different points of view. Made for RKO in 1941,
it has been placed at the top of Best Films lists by critics and
specialised magazines ever since. Citizen Kane was followed by The
Magnificent Ambersons (1942), a story about declining family fortunes and
the rise of the automobile that echoed his own life. Welless films were
praised for their ingenious techniqueslong takes and compositions in depth
that reinforced realism and gave spectators the freedom to scan the scene
in ways that classical editing did not allow, while also producing a
stylised, unnatural cinema (Bazin 2005; 1991, 64-82; Naremore 1989, 35).
      Welles started directing and acting already in his teenage years at
the Todd School for Boys, where he developed a special interest in
Shakespeare. After the divorce and death of his parents, Welles was sent to
Ireland to study painting but instead obtained his first professional role
at the Dublin Gate Theatre. Back in the United States he kept acting in
plays until in 1937 he and John Houseman established the Mercury Theatre,
one of the Federal Theatre companies in New York, where he staged a
revolutionary version of Julius Caesar that made him immensely popular. By
that time he was also known for his work on radio: in programs such as The
March of Time, The Shadow, in his own show First Person Singular, and in
The Mercury Theatre on the Air, whose extraordinarily realistic version of
The War of the Worlds threw Americans into a panic
(http://archive.org/details/OrsonWellesMrBruns). Pursuing also an early
interest in cinema, Welles took his Mercury Theatre actors to Hollywood to
make Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons, followed by three films
that failed at the box office: The Lady from Shanghai (1946), The Stranger
(1946) and Macbeth (1948). To the eyes of Hollywood, this trilogy about
power and its consequences revealed him as an eccentric, unreliable
director, and he did not make another Hollywood film for a decade.
      Alienated from the movie world and the society of the United States,
he moved to Europe, where production costs were lower, and continued his
career as an actor to finance films of a bizarre style such as Othello
(1952) (http://archive.org/details/FilmingOtheloByOrsonWelles), Mr. Arkadin
(1955), The Trial (1962), and the Shakespeare-based Chimes at Midnight
(1966). During this period, Welles returned to Hollywood to make the
expressionistic Touch of Evil in 1958, but then worked mainly as an actor
until his death at age 70. His ashes were taken to Spain and buried in the
country house of bullfighter Antonio Ordez.
