Zero de Conduite (Zero for Conduct, 1933)

Thomas Patrick Pringle (McGill University)

Directed by Jean Vigo, Zero for Conduct is a short film about young
boarding school students rebelling against their teachers strictures. The
film is an autobiographical take on Vigos youth and an homage to the
spirit of his infamous anarchist father, Miguel Almereyda. Accordingly,
Zero for Conduct was initially banned for its lawless attitude, and was
only released in 1945, more than a decade after Vigos early death. The
film is known for its impish charm and effervescent style; it blends a
scathing criticism of the harsh conditions of French boarding schools with
an anti-authoritarian anarchist politics, presented through the childrens
eyes. Gentle surreal touches recur throughout the film: the diminutive size
of the head lecturer, a pillow fight that concludes with a procession in
slow motion, and the fruit-pelting of the schools authorities, caught by
surprise by a group of ambushed children. This was Vigos third film, and,
with LAtalante, one of only two features. Zero for Conduct is a complex
work in its refusal to be defined by realism, fiction, or the fantastic.
The films influence has been profound, finding tribute in Franois
Truffauts The 400 Blows (1959) and Lindsay Andersons if (1968).
