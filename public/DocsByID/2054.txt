Voorslag (Whiplash) was a literary journal published in South Africa from 1926 to 1927. Sold as ‘A Magazine of South African Life and Art’, it appeared monthly until February 1927, then bi-monthly for one issue and finished as a quarterly: one in a long succession of little magazines, from the Pringle-Fairbairn South African Journal (1824), which sank after two issues, torpedoed by the threat of censorship, to Stephen Black’s Sjambok, launched in 1929, shipwrecked by libel action in 1931, and beyond. Funded by Lewis Reynolds, scion of a plantation sugar family, and edited by Roy Campbell (age 24), William Plomer (age 22) and Laurens van der Post (age 19) for its first three issues, Voorslag published verse, prose fiction and criticism, in English and Afrikaans. (Campbell intended to invite contributions in isiZulu.) The editors themselves contributed in all genres: perhaps most significantly, Campbell’s poem ‘The Albatross’ and his review of Eliot, Plomer’s ‘Portraits in the Nude’, and van der Post’s ‘Nimrods van die See’. Voorslag was important for its recognition and renewal of and commitment to South African culture, for the debate it provoked and for what it contributed to the subsequent career and oeuvre of each of its initial editors, but finally broke on the reefs between age and youth, colonial and metropolitan, capital and labour.
