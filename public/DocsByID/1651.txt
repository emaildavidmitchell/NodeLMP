Rodchenko, Aleksandr Mikhailovich
Born 23 November/5 December 1891, St. Petersburg, Imperial Russia
Died 3 December 1956, Moscow, USSR

Vladimir Tatlin invited Aleksandr Rodchenko to take part in the 1916 Moscow
exhibition, The Store, and thus did Rodchenko enter the Russian avant-
garde. Showing large non-objective ink drawings created with compasses and
geometrical structure, these two factors determined his painting and design
work until Socialist Realism was forced on art around 1930. From that time
Rodchenko relied on his camera, a Leica, to photograph communist
celebrations in Moscow and major construction and industrial projects
elsewhere, his photo-journalism being well-published because it was
considered good propaganda for the regime; it was awarded numerous prizes
during the 1930s. As with all the Russian avant-garde, their creative lives
were divided into periods of before and after 1930 but being a photo-
journalist allowed Rodchenko to continue to work innovatively during the
years of the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. It was between 1916 and
throughout the 1920s, however, that Rodchenko applied his creative mind to
a wide range of media, made possible by the new arts institutions 
teaching in art schools, film and theatre, publications, designing
advertising for the State stores and manufacturing (such as shoes or tea),
etc.  set up after the October Revolution of 1917. For that short period,
Rodchenkos art gave a new and modern look to graphic design in Russia.

Aleksandr Rodchenko began as a painter and his early non-objective canvases
were achieved by beaming rays of light onto a screen (1917-1918). These
were followed by his Black on Black paintings (1918-1919) of celestial
phenomena (eclipses, comets) and his Line paintings (1919-1920), called
Constructions, of pure geometrical spatial arrangements of forces. These
works were shown in two major avant-garde exhibitions in Moscow in 1919 and
in 1920  The 10th State ExhibitionNon-Objective Creation and Suprematism
and the 19th State Exhibition respectively, the latter including a
retrospective of the painting of Vasily Kandinsky. Geometry was fundamental
in Russian avant-garde art, and in modernism generally, because artists
were interested in the structures of order, from nature to the cosmos.
Hence geometry was essential for giving order to their art, especially as
it was the only means of capturing and expressing forces, the structures of
energy and its movement. That was the explicit subject matter of his non-
objective paintings, 1919-1921, several drawings illustrating the catalogue
of the famous 5 x 5 = 25 exhibition (Moscow 1921), and discussed by
Rodchenko in his article, The Line (1920). His modular sculptures of 1920-
1921 are three-dimensional explorations of this subject matter and the
depiction of forces through the order of geometry are the source of his
innovative graphic design throughout the 1920s. It was also basic in his
teaching of constructive principles at the Vkhutemas, 1921-1928, which
was applied in the Metalwork Department and furniture design. Rodchenko was
head of the Moscow Art Bureau of IZO Narkompros, 1920-1922, which purchased
works by the Russian avant-garde for the network of over 30 Museums of
Artistic Culture throughout Russia.
