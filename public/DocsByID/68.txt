Anderson, Margaret (1886-1973)
A passionate proponent of modernist arts and letters, publisher and author
Margaret Caroline Anderson is best known as the intrepid co-editor (with
Jane Heap) of  one of the eras most avant-garde literary and arts
magazines, The Little Review, which ran from 1914 to 1929, surviving
relocations between Chicago, California, New York, and Paris; and as the
author of a three-volume autobiography, My Thirty Years War (1930), The
Fiery Fountains (1951), and The Strange Necessity (1869). Born in
Indianapolis, Indiana, Anderson rebelled against her bourgeois upbringing
and moved to Chicago in 1908, where she worked at the Friday Literary
Review, a supplement to the Chicago Evening Post, writing literary reviews
under the editorial supervision of critic and socialist Floyd Dell (1887-
1969). She launched The Little Review in March 1914, and was joined by Heap
(1883-1964) in 1916. Their domestic and professional partnership, which
lasted until 1923, energized the modernist movement by giving a significant
platform to American and international figures, such as Ernest Hemingway,
Ezra Pound, Francis Picabia, and William Butler Yeats, but also to women
writers, such as Mary Butts, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Mina Loy, and
Dorothy Richardson. As Wojcik observes, the editors not only had a talent
for publishing authors who would become canonical within [twentieth]-
century literature, but for ensuring they faced a receptive public (61-
62); they did so through high- spirited conversation and debate.
      Despite financial hardships, including the withdrawal of advertising
revenue due to Andersons affiliation with anarchist dissident Emma
Goldman, Anderson and Heap (supported by foreign editors, notably Pound who
joined the Little Reviews masthead as Foreign Editor from 1917 to 1919),
worked formidably under the publications pugilistic slogan Making No
Comprise with the Public Taste, which announced the editors commitment
to radical and experimental avant-garde literature. Nevertheless, this
editorial ethos proved sufficiently controversial when the Little Review
serialized James Joyces Ulysses (1922) between 1918-1920: four separate
issues of the journal were seized and destroyed by the Post Office after
having been deemed obscene.. Upon publication of the Nausicaa episode
in 1920, legal proceedings led by John Sumner (1876-1971), then secretary
of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, were brought against
Anderson and Heap. They were tried for and convicted of obscenities
charges, despite art patron John Quinns (1870-1924) legal representation.
Andersons response to the farce and her reticence during the trial is
chronicled in the Little Review (1921) in an impassioned and vituperative
account of the affair entitled Ulysses in Court. After their separation
in 1923, Heap continued to publish The Little Review until 1926. A final
issue was released in 1929.
      Andersons My Thirty Years War deftly stages the crucial, strenuous
 and under-acknowledged  work of female publishers. In it, Anderson
frequently links the business of the magazine with the domestic spaces she
shared with Heap. Each of these spaces, which Anderson herself edited
(58), invariably completed by the addition of a (borrowed) Mason and Hamlin
piano (as Anderson was a skilled pianist and espoused a demonstrable
preference for Mason and Hamlin models), would serve as the de facto
editorial offices for the Little Review. Andersons later life was marked
by her study of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff (1866-1949), about whom she
taught and wrote until her death in 1973. She lived with French opera
singer Georgette Leblanc (1875-1941) until the singers death in 1941.
