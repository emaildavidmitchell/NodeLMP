Filippo Tommaso MARINETTI (1876-1944)

The founder and leader of FUTURISM, the first intellectual and artistic
movement that explicitly defined the codes of avant-garde practice in the
twentieth century. His work extended across a multiplicity of fields:
journalism, poetry, literature, theatre, visual arts, politics, but its
probably his all-encompassing activity as a cultural leader and fosterer of
innovation that made him one of the pre-eminent intellectuals of his time.
He implemented and systematized the practice of diffusing avant-garde ideas
through manifestos, performances and happenings, capitalizing on a
deliberately magnified antagonistic relation with the tastes of the public
at large. His experimentations in visual/verbal relations and stage
performances, which led to the creation of free-word poetry and synthetic
theatre, were pivotal for the development of new modernist codes in poetry
and the performing arts.

He was born (real name Emilio Angelo Carlo) on December 22, 1876, in
Alexandria, Egypt, the second son of a Piedmontese lawyer. While still a
student at the local French Jesuit lyce, he published his first literary
magazine, Le Papyrus. In 1894 he went to study in Paris and first came into
contact with the citys literary and artistic scene.  He subsequently moved
to Milan, but continued to be actively involved in Parisian literary
circles. One of his mentors was the Symbolist poet GUSTAVE KAHN, a champion
of free verse poetry. Marinetti became an influential actor in the cultural
exchanges between France and Italy, collaborating with the major French
literary journals of the time and serving as the secretary of Anthologie-
Revue de France et d'Italie: Recueil mensuel de littrature et d'art. His
first collection of poems, La Conqute des toiles, was published in 1902.
During these years of literary experimentation, he was influenced by the
writings of NIETZSCHE and BERGSON, the theories of Bakunin and SOREL, and
the rise of anarcho-syndicalism. Marinettis first major play, Le Roi
Bombance, reveals his interest in contemporary ideological debates. Written
in 1905 and modeled on ALFRED JARRYs Ubu Roi, this violent satire attacked
the major Italian political figures of the time. In the same year,
Marinetti launched a literary journal, Poesia. Rassegna internazionale
(1905-1909), which he financed and directed.
At the beginning of 1909 Marinetti founded the Futurist Movement by
disseminating a now famous manifesto which was published in several Italian
newspapers and, more crucially, on the front page of the Parisian daily Le
Figaro. With the progressive expansion of the movement, he orchestrated a
series of outrageous artistic as well as political soires, furthering, to
cite the title of one of his manifestos, The Pleasure of Being Booed. These
public events, together with the continual release of new manifestos,
constituted the core of the Futurist strategy of cultural and ideological
shock and assault on the public. Even his first novel, Mafarka le
futuriste. Roman africain (1910, in French and in Italian translation),
created a considerable uproar in Italy when it was tried in court for
obscenity. Particularly influential were his manifestos aimed at
revolutionizing the performing arts and literature. The latter theorized
the destruction of syntax, the use of onomatopoeia and typographical
innovations, and led to the invention of free-word poetry and tavole
parolibere. In the 1920s and 30s, his work returned to a more narrative
approach. Marinetti maintained, however, a strong experimental attitude
toward the temporal and psychological structure of his works, at times even
offering alternative endings to his novels (see Gli amori futuristi -
programmi di vita con varianti a scelta [1922]). Similarly, his plays
assumed a distinctly a-logical organization, prefiguring the thtre de
labsurde. In the fight against what he saw as the advocates of tradition,
he coined the famous Futurist concept of antipassatismo (literally anti-
pastism) and conceptualized the involvement of Futurism in Italian
political affairs as a necessary step in the movements core program of
radical, cultural revolution. He served as a correspondent from the front
during the war between Italy and Turkey, collecting his essays in La
Battaglia di Tripoli (1911) and reworked the experience of the Turkish-
Bulgarian war in the form of a series of tavole parolibere, published in
Zang Tumb Tuuum (1914). He often spectacularly recited his own poetry. At
the outbreak of World War I, he organized several demonstrations calling
for Italy to enter the conflict on the side of France. At one such
demonstration at the Piazza Duomo in Milan, he burned an Austrian flag, an
action for which he was arrested. After Italys involvement in the
conflict, he served in the Italian army and was injured in battle.
Following the armistice of 1918, Marinettis political activity culminated
in the organization of war veterans, including the special assault troops
(Arditi), into the political movement of the Fasci Politici Futuristi,
which in due course merged with BENITO MUSSOLINIs Fasci di Combattimento
in preparation for the elections of 1919. Marinettis political program for
the Fasci is contained in his 1919 volume, Democrazia Futurista. As his
diary entries show, he maintained a cautious attitude toward Mussolinis
suspected right-wing leanings and, after their defeat at the ballot box, he
stepped down from Central Committee of the party in May 1920. The years
1920 and 1921 saw the publication of the essay Al di l del Comunismo and a
rapprochement between Marinetti and the political Left. Eventually, with
the advent to power of Fascism, he reworked some of his programmatic ideas
on public patronage for the avant-garde and presented them as a Manifesto
al Governo Fascista (1923). Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he devoted
himself to the reorganization of Futurism as an artistic movement, planning
conferences and exhibitions that would maintain the groups visibility in
Italy and abroad in the face of increasing competition from newer avant-
garde movements. The Dadaists, for instance, staged a protest at the 1921
presentation of his manifesto Le Tactilisme. In the 1930s, his association
with Fascism led to increasing contestations, especially at the Pen Club
congresses, where he participated as the Italian representative. He never
hid his aversion for Hitlers politics. In 1933, on behalf of WASSILY
KANDINSKY, he intervened to prevent the closure of the Bauhaus and, after
Italys alliance with Nazism, he protested the introduction of racial laws.
Still, he maintained his early fascination with war, enlisting first in the
war in Ethiopia and, at the age of 66, in the ARMIR expedition to Russia
during World War II. After his return to Italy he joined the Repubblica
Sociale Italiana and died in Bellagio on December 2, 1944.
