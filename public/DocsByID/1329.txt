Muir, Willa (1890-1969)

Willa Muir was born Wilhelmina Anderson in Montrose in the north-east of
Scotland.  Her parents were immigrants from Shetland and she early learned
to be bilingual, an activity which may have developed her later linguistic
skills. After graduating with a first class degree in Classics from St
Andrews University in 1912 and teaching educational psychology in London,
she married the poet EDWIN MUIR in 1919, travelled with him in Europe in
the 1920s, and became the principal linguist in their translations of the
fiction of FRANZ KAFKA. She also translated German works on her own under
the pen-name of Agnes Neill Scott. Her two novels Imagined Corners (1931)
and Mrs Ritchie (1933) made a significant contribution to Scottish fiction
and especially to new writing by women; while her Hogarth Press essay
Women: An Inquiry (1925) and the later Mrs Grundy in Scotland (1936)
explored feminist issues of the time. After Edwins death she published
Belonging (1969), her personal perspective on their life together. Her
published work, letters, journals and other manuscript writings identify
her as a European intellectual as well as a modern woman writer.
