Shōchiku produced adaptations of Western masterpieces such as King Lear and Le Tartuffe written in a modern, colloquial speech and gradually extended its repertoire to shimpa, modern comedies, revues and variety shows. Shōchiku invited the comedy troupe Soganoya Brothers Ichiza, formed by Gorō and Jūrō for the 1904 opening of Kyoto Asahiza. Following the comedy boom sparked by Soganoya Comedy, Shōchiku formed the comedy group at Asahiza in 1906. Gorō continued to act in Shōchiku’s theatres in Osaka and Tokyo till his death. In 1928 Shibuya Tengai, recommended by Jūrō, formed the comedy group, Shōchiku Home Drama. In 1948, Gorō and Tengai’s groups’ members formed Shōchiku Shinkigeki led by Tengai and young Fujiyama Kanbi.



In downtown Tokyo, when Asakusa Opera’s popularity came to prime time in 1919, Shōchiku formed Shinsei Opera Company to produce Asakusa in Shōchiku-owned theatres in Japan. Influenced by Takarazuka Girls Opera, Shōchiku Girls Opera Group (Later, SKD) was formed. Its Tokyo Dance (1930) at Asakusa Shōchikuza attracted many audiences and became a local specialty of Tokyo. The following year Asakusa Shōchikuza became a revue theatre, which became the base of popular comedian Enomoto Kenichi’s troupe Pierre Brilliante in 1932. Enomoto’s contract with Shōchiku continued until 1937 when he moved to Tōhō and brought extreme popularity. At another Shōchiku-owned theatre called Tokiwaza, other comedy troupes including Furukawa Roppa’s The Kingdom of Laughter, performed. In 1930, Tokyo Theatre, a modern theatre newly built to stage both theatre and film, was opened in the district of Tsukiji, whose premiere was Hasegawa Shin's film When I Became a Sumō-wrestler Champion (1931).



Shōchiku’s involvement with film began in 1920 when the company established Shōchiku Kinema Gomeisha (Shōchiku after 1937) and opened a studio in Kamata, Tokyo. Inside the studio, Shōchiku Kinema Acting School was established under modern Japanese drama shingeki’s leader Osanai Kaoru. Shōchiku’s first film was A Woman from the Island (1920) at Tokyo’s Kabukiza. In 1936, Shōchiku moved the film studio to Ofuna. The company produced early silent films and talkies, including the first talkie Gosho Heinosuke’s The Neighbor’s Wife and Mine (1931) and the first color motion picture Kinoshita Keisuke’s Carmen Comes Home (1951). Shōchiku’s leading film directors include Yasujirō Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Mikio Naruse. Shōchiku also imported and produced foreign films since 1920, including Paramount Pictures’ The Ten Commandments (1923). In Osaka, Shirai built the first Western style movie theatre Shōchikuza in 1923, whose premiere was German film The Love of Pharaoh (1922). Female only Osaka Shōchiku Opera Company’s song and dance was performed as an attraction of the film.
