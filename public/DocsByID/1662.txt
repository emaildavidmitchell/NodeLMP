Roberto Rossellini (Roberto Gastone Zeffiro Rossellini, Rome, 8 May 1906 – 3 June 1977) was an Italian film director, screenwriter and producer. His early work appeared at the height of Fascism—two shorts, now lost, on the subject of nature: Daphne (1936) and Prélude à l'aprés-midi d'un faune (1938). At the beginning of the 1940s, he released his first feature films exalting the virtues of World War II combatants: La nave bianca (1941), on a group of Italian sailors on a hospital ship, Un pilota ritorna (1942), on the war between Italy and Greece, and L’uomo della croce (1943), about military chaplains on the Russian front. With these three films, which are often referred to as the ‘Fascist trilogy’, Rossellini’s work is considered to be highly controversial for his use of certain Fascist ideological themes that he would definitively abandon in the war’s aftermath. This trilogy already crosses realism and documentary filming with social aesthetics, humanist concerns, and a sharp observation of everyday life. These traits will characterize Rossellini’s postwar neorealism and will never completely disappear from the different phases of his future work.

This trilogy already crosses realism and documentary filming with social aesthetics, humanist concerns, and a sharp observation of everyday life. These traits will characterize Rossellini’s postwar neorealism and will never completely disappear from the different phases of his future work. 



In fact, with the trilogy Roma città aperta (1945), Paisà (1946), and Germania anno zero (1948), Rossellini is acknowledged as the founding father of neorealism, understanding realism as nothing but the artistic form of truth, and cinema as a means to ‘show’, not to explain, and thus to conduct a social inquiry. The first two of these social films evoke the war of liberation from fascist and Nazi oppressors, while Germania deals with the traumatic aftermath to World War II and the fall of the Third Reich. Towards the end of the decade, Rossellini turns away from the experience of war and works on two comedies: L’amore (1948), dedicated to Anna Magnani, who also acts in the movie, and La macchina ammazzacattivi (1952), a Brechtian reflection on evil. 



In 1948, the already famous Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman, after seeing Roma città aperta and Paisà, writes to Rossellini proposing to collaborate. This letter signals the beginning of one of the most popular and controversial love stories in the history of cinema, and, at the same time, Rossellini’s engagement with a cinema of intimacy where social analysis encounters spiritual exploration. Rossellini’s new phase, which spans the first half of the 1950s, is concerned with the personal anxiety, crisis of communication, and loss of traditional values produced by Fascism and the war. Stromboli, terra di Dio (1950), filmed on the slopes of the Italian volcano that gives the movie its title, is the first work with Bergman, followed by Europa '51 (1952), Siamo Donne (1953), Viaggio in Italia (1953), La paura (1954), and Giovanna d'Arco al rogo (1954). Stromboli and Viaggio in Italia drew the attention of future French New Wave’s filmmakers—then critics—François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and Éric Rohmer, who considered Rossellini one of the first modern auteurs. As a result of such admiration, Godard invited Rossellini to work on the screenplay of Les Carabiniers (The carabineers, 1963). 



In 1957 Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister, invited Rossellini to film a documentary in India. The journey triggers his break-up with Bergman and his subsequent marriage with Sonali Das Gupta, a screenwriter for the film. It also gives rise to an exotic detour in his career, represented by L’India vista da Rossellini and India Matru Bhumi, a title that combines fiction and documentary. In these years Rossellini looks for new perspectives and returns to the theme of the war with Il generale della Rovere (1959), winner of the Golden Lion at Venice, and Era notte a Roma (1960). In the 60s, with Viva l’Italia (1960) depicting Garibaldi’s epic campaign in 19th century Sicily during the Risorgimento, Rossellini begins what is considered to be his didactic and educational phase, concerned with the history of Western civilization. In 1961, he releases Vanina Vanini, an adaptation of the homonymous tale by Stendhal, and in 1966 La presa del potere da parte de Luigi XIV. At the beginning of the 70s, Rossellini makes a number of films for television, which he praises for its pedagogical potentiality against pernicious mass society. These movies treat the lives of historical figures such as Socrate (1971), Agostino d’Ippona (1972), L’età di Cosimo dei Medici (1972), Cartesio (1973), and Il messia (1975), on the figure of Christ. Rossellini dies of a heart attack in 1977 returning from the Cannes Film Festival.
