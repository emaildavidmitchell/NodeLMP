TILLICH, Paul Johannes (1886-1965)



Paul Tillich was born in Prussia, studied in Germany, and received his Doctorate (1911) from the University of Breslau. He was an ordained Lutheran minister and served as a professor of Theology and Philosophy at the Universities of Berlin, Marburg, Leipzig, and Frankfurt am Main, where his lectures on communalism criticized Nazism. He lost his teaching post, and was forced to emigrate in 1933. He taught at Union Theological Seminary in New York. After retiring in 1954, he served as University Professor at Harvard Divinity School, and then the University of Chicago. His major works include Systematic Theology in three volumes (1951, 1957, 1963), The Courage to Be (1952), The New Being (1955), and Theology of Culture (1959). Tillich influenced neo-orthodoxy, but criticized liberal theology, instead borrowing heavily from Heideggerâ€™s existentialist ontology. He saw Christianity as symbolic of the human state, and God as wholly other to human being: revelation of divine feelings or experiences relieved human anxiety about non-being. Art too expressed revelation in a world made shallow by industrialization and routine. In his theory of culture, the Church (primarily Christian institutions) and Culture are within each other, and the Church should hear and judge prophetic voices, regardless of their origin.
