 MEDE, CUTHY

Cuthbert (Cuthy) Mede was born in Zimbabwe in 1949 to Malawian parents and grew up on Likoma Island, Lake Malawi. His artwork is the best known internationally of any Malawian artist.  Mede is known for his cubist forms and pointillist style, uniting modern art techniques with traditional Malawian subjects.  His work is inspired by his religious beliefs and local imagery. Beginning with a point of light,  Medeâ€™s best-known style emerges in wavy lines of white light over portraits of local people, or vivid primary colors of dancing, celebration and movement.  A single dot of light gives perspective to his pointillism paintings. His subjects are distinctly local: a woman with snuff, a witchdoctor, mother and child; traditional instruments, cooking pots, and imaginary spirit forms in reds, oranges and blues.   Cuthy Mede taught modern art in Chancellor College as a young man, but soon became a successful artist.  Mede opened the first art gallery in Malawi, Gallerie Africaine, in the City Centre, Lilongwe in the early 1980s, and exhibited his works throughout Malawi from the 1970s, selling worldwide.  In recent years Mede is known for his fluorescent tube white garden and artworks all in white.
