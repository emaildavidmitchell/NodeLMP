Robert Beavers is an American experimental filmmaker best known for My Hand Outstretched to the Winged Distance and Sightless Measure, an epic cycle comprosed of eighteen of his films (many later re-edited), made since 1967.  Beavers’s use of shaped mattes to obscure aspects of the image and gelatine filters that produce varieties of coloured light are hallmarks of some of his films, many of which observe hand- and craftwork (including his own filmmaking). 

Robert Beavers is an American experimental filmmaker best known for My Hand Outstretched to the Winged Distance and Sightless Measure, an epic cycle comprosed of eighteen of his films (many later re-edited), made since 1967.  Beavers’s use of shaped mattes to obscure aspects of the image and gelatine filters that produce varieties of coloured light are hallmarks of some of his films, many of which observe hand- and craftwork (including his own filmmaking). 

Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, Beavers attended Deerfield Academy before meeting the filmmaker Gregory J. Markopoulos in 1966. They moved to Europe in 1967 and removed their films from distribution; Beavers did not show his films in the United States again until 1996. 



He made films in Greece, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. His early Plan of Brussels and Winged Dialogue (1967-68; re-edited in 2000) are multilayered psychic explorations; From the Notebook of...(1971; 1998) is set in Florence and inspired by Leonardo's notebooks. Ruskin (1975; 1997) is shot at various sites of the titular artist and critic’s work in London: the Alps and Venice. Beavers’s only film to use intertitles, the dialogic Sotiros (1976 to 1978; 1996) marks the end of his use of filters and mattes. Wingseed (1985), The Hedge Theater (1986 to 1990; 2002), The Stoas (1991 to 1997), and The Ground (1993 to 2001) dwell in pastoral environments and Baroque spaces in Italy and Greece. 



Beavers has produced three films outside the Hand Outstretched cycle: Pitcher of Coloured Light (2007) and The Suppliant (2010), both shot in the United States; and Listening to the Space in My Room (2013). 



He lives with the German filmmaker Ute Aurand in Berlin and in Massachusetts.
