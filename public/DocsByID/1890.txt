Suprematism 1915 - 1920s

Suprematism is the painting of light, from colour to light itself.
Originally developed by Kazimir Malevich in 1915 (he showed 39 Suprematist
canvases in the Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0.10, Petrograd,
December 1915-January 1916), the word Suprematism meant, according to
him, dominant, a common artists term which here referred specifically to
colour in the painters eye and so on the canvas. Suprematism could be said
to be the logical development of Parisian Impressionism, the exploration of
colour in light and that of Claude Monet in particular. Originating in
optical afterimages in 1915, Malevich went on to use spinning discs and
light projectors, 1916-1919, to capture light itself. Artists in Malevichs
milieu such as Ivan Kliun began to investigate colour using discs in 1914,
while between 1916 and 1919 there was a surge of experimentation with discs
and projectors. Kliun, Alexandra Exter, Liubov Popova, Aleksandr Rodchenko
and Olga Rozanova produced a great variety of paintings of colour and light
and, apart from Exter, they showed together at the first major group
exhibition, Non-Objective Creation and Suprematism (Moscow, 1919). In 1920
Malevich went to teach at the Practical Art Institute in Vitebsk where El
Lissitzky adapted architectural geometrical systems to a Suprematism of the
cosmos, and Malevichs students such as Ilia Chashnik and Nikolai Suetin
also moved on to the Suprematism of cosmic space and infinity, seen at the
1923 Petrograd Exhibition of All Trends, the final manifestation of
Suprematist painting. These artists adapted Suprematism to the design of
porcelain and graphics in the 1920s.

Exploring how the eye sees colour and light, Kazimir Malevich began
experimenting with the optical phenomenon of afterimages produced in the
eye by strong light, notably the sun, when fields of bright, luminous
colours at the light-end of the spectrum appear  reds, oranges, yellows.
If the light is diminished by, say, a cloud passing over, colours at the
dark-end of the spectrum appear  greens, blues, violets. Malevich then
organised these phenomena of optical, spectral colours in a luminous field
of light, the white canvas, using a geometrical system, most commonly that
of how the eye actually sees; he sometimes used a simplified non-Euclidean
geometry in order to capture wide, expansive spatiality. In 1916, Malevich
began to explore a particular characteristic of vision, that of luminosity.
For this he used spinning discs, a device employed by scientists for
measuring luminosity in the eye, Malevichs source being Hermann von
Helmholtzs scientific Treatise on Physiological Optics of the 1860s. He
titled these works Supremus. In the spinning discs Malevich became aware
of the energy of centrifugal forces and he did a group of Supr[ematist]
Construction of Colour in 1917-1918 which he called Non-Objective
Suprematism, non-objective referring to these forces. In 1917, following
the initiative of Rozanova, Malevich began to compose with beams of
coloured light thrown onto a screen by light projectors. This was followed
in 1918 and 1919 by his White on White canvases, paintings of light itself.
In 1919 and 1920, canvases titled Suprematism of the Spirit was a
Suprematism of the space of infinity which only the mind can imagine.
