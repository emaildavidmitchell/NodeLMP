1 Yizhar, S. (1916-2006)


   Acknowledged as the first Israeli writer since his first story Ephraim
   khozer la-aspeset (Ephraim Goes Back to Alfalfa) from 1938, Yizhar
   Smilansky has been the first Israeli-born Hebrew writer to use modern
   sabra Hebrew as a literary language. He was 22 at the time, and has
   since come to be considered Israel's most illustrious writer.


   Born September 27th 1916 in Rehovoth, educated in Jerusalem, he served
   as an intelligence officer in the IDF, an experience later reflected in
   his writing. He was elected to Parliament six consecutive times (1949-
   1966. Following the Six Days War he refrained from formal political
   activity and concentrated on education and on his writing. He was a
   guest lecturer in the New York Theological Seminary (1968), lecturer in
   the department of Education in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1970-
   1980), Professor in the Hebrew Literature Department of Tel-Aviv
   Universiy (1980-1988), and a Fellow in the Research Institute for Jewish
   Studies at Harvard University (1967, 1987). From 1988 almost to his last
   day he taught Literature at the Levinsky Seminary in Tel-Aviv. His work
   was translated into several languages, mainly English, German and
   French. Khirbet Khizeh alone was translated into nine languages. Various
   volumes of Selected Stories appeared in German (1998), Arabic (1988) and
   French (2000). Yemei Ziklag, his major work, has not been translated.

   Yizhars early writing was published in the 1930s and 1940s, and was a
   dramatic breakthrough in modern Hebrew literature. Ephraim khozer la-
   aspeset was published in the literary journal Gilyonot edited by Yitzhak
   Lamdan, who gave him his pen-name S. Yizhar. After Ephraim he published
   more stories, then the novella Be-faatei Negev (On the Edge of the
   Negev, 1945), and the short story collection Ha-khorsha ba-giv'a (A
   Forest on the Hill, 1947). In 1949, at the age of 33 he published two of
   his most controversial stories, Khirbet Khizeh and Ha-shavuy (The
   Prisoner), raising moral issues of occupation and injustice. In Khirbet
   Khizeh he described the expulsion of Palestinian Arabs from their
   village by the IDF during the War of Independence. It was a singular
   voice at the time, though it did not prevent his nomination to the
   Knesset in the ruling Mapai party, the youngest MP. In 1950 he published
   Shayara shel khatzot (Midnight Convoy) and a collection of stories for
   youth Shisha sipurei qayitz (Six Summer Stories). At 42 he had already
   written his incontestable masterpiece Yemei Ziklag (Days of Ziklag,
   1958), comprising 2 volumes and more than a thousand pages, and by the
   age of 43 he had been awarded the prestigious Israel Prize for
   literature.

Several collections of stories followed: Sipurei Mishor (Stories of a
Plain, 1963), as well as some stories for children published in the Davar
Li'yladim journal, such as Ha-kirkara shel ha-dod moshe (Uncle Moshe's
Carriage, 1960). Indifferent, sometimes hostile response from editors and
critics made him renounce prose writing.
A thirty year period of literary silence followed, which he devoted to
teaching, to obtaining a PhD in Education, and to non-fiction writing of a
distinct non-conformist nature. On education: Al khinuch ve-al khinuch le-
arachim (On Education and Education for Values, 1974), Kria le-khinuch (A
Call for Education, 1984), Preida min ha-khinuch, (Farewell to Education,
1989), Shnei pulmusim (Two Controversies, 1990); on reading literature:
Liqro sipur (To Read a Story, 1982), Sipur eyno (A Story Is Not, 1983); on
political issues: Dapei riv (Quarrel Pages, 1988).
His late writing appeared in the 1990s and was enthusiastically acclaimed
by public and critics. It was triggered by the request of publisher Zmora
to reprint his Yemei Ziklag. Yizhar was 76 years old when he broke his by
now legendary literary silence with Miqdamot (Preliminaries, 1992),
followed by five more masterpieces: Tzalhavim (1993), Tzdadiyim (Asides,
1996), Etzel ha-yam (By the sea, 1996), Malkomia yefefia (Lovely Malcolmia,
1998), and Giluy Eliyahu (Discovering Elijah, 1999). He stopped writing at
83, and spent the next years teaching and reading until his death in August
22nd 2006.





   Yizhar was awarded many honorary doctorates, by the Weizman Institute
   (1991), by the University of Haifa (1994) and by the Hebrew University
   of Jerusalem (1996). He was awarded the Brenner Prize and the Israel
   Prize (1959) for his Yemei Ziklag. He was also awarded the Rupin prize
   (1948), the Lamdan Prize for children's literature (1960), the Usishkin
   Prize (1963), The Akum Prize (1989), the Bialik Prize (1993), The
   Israeli Literature Prize (1994), the Ben-Gurion Prize (2001) and the
   Emet Prize (2002).

Yizhar brought a unique and innovative style to modern Hebrew literature.
His perfect knowledge of the Bible and ancient sources, his mastery of
modern Hebrew in its various registers, combined with his inventiveness and
his acute ear for musicality make his style inimitable and difficult to
translate. The complexity of his writing, the stream of consciousness he
uses contributes to its uniqueness. So does his knowledge of Israeli
geology, geomorphology, climate and flora, evident in his landscape
descriptions and his emphasis on the relationship between person and place.
