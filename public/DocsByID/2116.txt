Wolff, Christian (1934)

Stephen Chase

Composer closely associated with the introduction and development of
indeterminacy in Western musical composition from the 1950s to the early
21st-century through alternative musical notations, performer interaction
and improvisation, and whose work has raised questions about the
relationship between the avant-garde and political engagement.

Born in Nice, France, of German parentage, Wolffs family arrived in New
York in 1941. At the age of 16, Wolff took composition lessons with John
Cage. After a short period of instruction Wolff was quickly welcomed into
Cages coterie which included fellow composers Morton Feldman and Earle
Brown, pianist David Tudor, and other figures associated with the artistic
movement known as the New York School.

Wolffs early music resembled aspects of late Webern in its static atonal
harmony and Cage in its rhythmic organisation and frequent use of prepared
piano. What distinguished the music from these models was Wolffs use of
limited pitch resources  Duo for Violins (1951), for example, makes use of
just three pitches: D Eb and E  and a radical discontinuity of line and
texture. From the late 1950s he turned increasingly to more spontaneous,
performer-led forms of composing. Initially this was through providing
limited performer choice of pitches and dynamics within specified time
frames (Duo for Pianists I (1957)), and then through scores which demanded
of the performers intensely concentrated listening for aural cues from
fellow performers in order to determine the next section of the score to
play (For 1, 2 or 3 People (1964)).

This more interactive approach to composition was further encouraged during
a sabbatical in the UK in 1968-69. Wolff performed frequently with the
improvising group AMM (whose membership included Cornelius Cardew) leading
to the graphic score, Edges (1968), and worked with liberal arts students,
which led to the non-specialist text notations of Prose Collection (1968-
71). The culmination of this period was Burdocks (1970-71) a compendium
score for a large group of performers with an indeterminate
instrumentation, inspired in part by activities of Cardews anarchic
Scratch Orchestra.

In the early 1970s, much like his friends Cardew and Frederic Rzewski,
Wolff felt the need to relate his work to his political interests and
attempt to engage more directly with a wider non-specialist audience. Wolff
made use of songs associated with political protest from which he would
weave a motley patchwork of variations  one of the clearest statements
being Wobbly Music (1975-76) for voices and ensemble, which derives its
texts and music from songs and speeches by the Industrial Workers of the
World. Often in Wolffs pieces the musical source is embedded at a deep
level: the piano version of Bread and Roses (1976) uses the union song of
the title as a resource of pitch material and rhythmic shapes which are
treated according to various methods of transposition and additive
procedures, the original tune only makes fleeting appearances during the
piece.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Wolff continued to refer to political
themes, and many titles reference songs and figures of protest Emma
[Goldman] (1989), and the occasional series of pieces titled Peace March
(1983 ).

From the 1990s and into the early twenty-first century Wolffs music began
to take on more of a public profile in music circles with a number of
orchestral commissions, his performances providing music for the Merce
Cunningham Dance Company, and more unusual projects such as working with
the alternative rock band Sonic Youth on a recording of his scores Edges
and Burdocks.

Wolffs oeuvre is prolific and ranges from pieces for most of the main
classical ensemble formations, numerous pieces for freely determined
instrumentations, and piano solos ranging in duration from 1 hour (Long
Piano (Peace March 10) (2004-05)) to collections of miniatures in
dedication to friends and colleagues (Keyboard Miscellany (1988-)).

His dual career as a Professor of Classics and as a composer may have
obscured his wider significance and influence when placed alongside the
larger-than-life personalities and conceptual purity of his mentors Cage
and Feldman. However, his ethically motivated and collaborative approach to
music making has exerted a strong influence over his own and subsequent
generations of composers and performers, ranging widely from Brian Enos
generative music and John Zorns cue-based pieces to the Wandelweiser
Collective and improvising musicians of varying stripes.
