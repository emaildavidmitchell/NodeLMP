VAGINOV, Konstantin Konstantinovich Wagenheim (, 
 ) (1899-1934)

Russian poet and novelist who at different points was affiliated with a
number of literary groups in Petrograd/Leningrad. The theme of the northern
capital where he spent most of his life occupies a central position in his
writings. He is best known for his four novels in which he ironically
depicts the demise of Russias pre-revolutionary Silver Age in the Soviet
Union of the late 1920s-early 1930s. Born on April 16, 1899 in St.
Petersburg, died in Leningrad on April 26, 1934. Born Konstantin
Konstantinovich Wagenheim, Vaginov grew up in the family of a high ranking
police official of German (and possibly Jewish) background. The family
Russified their name after the start of World War I. Vaginov attended the
Law Faculty of Petrograd University from where he was called up to join the
Red Army in 1919. Upon return to his home city, he was active in several
literary circles, including Acmeist Nikolai GUMILEVs Poets Guild which he
joined in 1921; he also co-founded the group Islanders in whose collected
volume his poetry was first published. In 1924, Vaginov met the critic and
philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin; members of Bakhtins intellectual circle later
served as prototypes for his first novel Goat Song (1927). From 1927
Vaginov was affiliated with the avant-garde group OBERIU, and together with
its key members, participated in Oberius famous evening Three Left Hours
which he parodied in his second novel Works and Days of Svistonov (1929).
In 1931, Vaginov was subjected to a vicious attack by members of the
proletarian writers group RAPP. His last two prose works Bambocciada
(1931) and Harpagoniana  (1933, unpublished in Vaginovs lifetime) explore
many of the same themes as his first two novels but in them irony and
carnival give way to grotesque.  Vaginov died of tuberculosis in 1934,
after a long illness.
