Work

Fernando Cerqueira’s works can be considered a musical reflex of his career: while singing in the UFBA madrigal choir, he composed several arrangements of Brazilian folk and popular music (Samba de Roda na Capoeira, Duas Cantigas de Roda, Imbalança, Na Bahia Tem, Carolina, Roda Viva); integrating the “Composers’ Group of Bahia”, he produced avant-gardist original works, many of which were prizewinners in national festivals and competitions (Metamorfose I op. 2, Transubstanciação op. 3, Heterofonia do tempo op. 4,  Contração, op. 5, Decantação op. 6); teaching ‘composition workshop’ at the Brasília University Foundation, he elaborated many sketches for collective improvisation with didactic purpose; while integrating the staff of UFBA “School of Music and Scenic Arts”, he composed several audiocomplements for Dance and Theater (Música para Percussão,  A Vertigem do Sagrado, Álbum de Família, Diz que Sim - Diz que Não, Yerma, Bailes Pastoris da Bahia); while studying for his Master Degree in Theory of Literature (1990-1994) he was interested in the intimate relationship between poetry and musical conception, a product of which is Desnovelo op. 29; and, finally, as Music Coordinator of the ‘Axé Project’, he has composed works for scenic spectacles using the musical forces of the project (pop band, percussion band, berimbau orchestra), examples of which are his Três Ambiências para a Bandaxé and Composição para Quietude na Terra.



Cerqueira’s musical production embrace works for solo instrument (flute, oboe, clarinet / bass-clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, voice, piano and guitar), traditional and original chamber formations, choir (a cappella and with instrumental accompaniment), chamber and symphonic orchestra, and choir and orchestra (with or without solo voices). Among these categories, quantitatively expressive is his music for a cappella choir and non-traditional mixed ensembles.



Fernando Cerqueira was distinguished in many National competitions and won international visibility through expositions, publications, and recordings. Contração (1969, mixed ensemble) was exposed in the “Tribune Internationale des Compositeurs” (1970, Paris); Quanta (1972, for mixed ensemble) was the only Latin-American composition selected in 1974 for the “Jours Musicaux” of the ISCM in Holland (Den Haag); Quanta and Síndrome (1973, string quartet) were published in Germany by TONOS Verlag (Darmstadt) in 1974; Sete Esboços para Espantar G. D’Arezzo (1989, percussion duo) was published in the United States by Brazilian Music Enterprise (WA) in 1995 and recorded in the same year by GHA (Brussels).



Cerqueira’s work was theme of a Doctoral thesis of the Graduate Music Program at UFBA: “O Pensamento Composicional de Fernando Cerqueira: memórias e paradigmas” by Ângelo Tavares Castro was defended in 2004 and published in 2007 by the Federal University of Bahia Press. In his book “Artimanhas do Compor e do Pensar: percurso criativo através de textos” (Salvador: Quarteto, Série Fundação Gregório de Mattos, vol. 5, 2007), a collection of articles, essays, expositions and testimonies, the composer comments some of his works.



In 2011, his musical work was catalogued by the research project ‘Historical Landmarks of Contemporary Composition at UFBA’. This catalogue, with 78 musical items, includes the composer’s life chronology, bibliography and discography.
