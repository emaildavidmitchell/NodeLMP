The term ‘Valparaiso School’ is often applied to the school of architecture, design and arts of the Catholic University of Valparaiso, in specific relation to a novel academic approach initiated in 1952 and established in 1967 through an academic reform. The shift in teaching strategies implied the rejection of a Beaux-Arts-inspired syllabus in favour of a particularly local approach that involved new interests, processes and products, in part inspired by aspects of imported heroic modernism. The main promoters of this change were architect Alberto Cruz and poet Godofredo Iommi. 



Alberto Cruz was born in 1917. He studied architecture at the Catholic University in Santiago from 1934. After graduating, he became a teacher there and participated in movements to change the school’s syllabus in 1949. In 1975 he received the National Architecture Award, given by the Chilean Architects’ Association. Godofredo Iommi, from Argentina, was born in 1917 and studied two years of Economics in Buenos Aires before leaving his studies uncompleted. Instead, he began a poetic practice, inspired by modern Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro.

Alberto Cruz was born in 1917. He studied architecture at the Catholic University in Santiago from 1934. After graduating, he became a teacher there and participated in movements to change the school’s syllabus in 1949. In 1975 he received the National Architecture Award, given by the Chilean Architects’ Association. Godofredo Iommi, from Argentina, was born in 1917 and studied two years of Economics in Buenos Aires before leaving his studies uncompleted. Instead, he began a poetic practice, inspired by modern Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro. 



Both Cruz and Iommi joined the Valparaiso School in 1952. Cruz was invited by its rector, Jorge Gonzalez. He accepted the nomination, with the condition that Iommi and six other teachers be invited to join as well — these were Francisco Méndez, Miguel Eyquem, Jaime Bellalta, Fabio Cruz Prieto, José Vial Armstrong, and Arturo Baeza. This first act of collectivism would permeate the entire ethos of the school under the influence of Cruz and Iommi. 



Immediately after joining, they would create the Institute of Architecture that would allow for innovative forms of research and teaching within the School. Under the influence of Cruz and Iommi, the Institute began to explore interests foreign to the traditional academic teaching of the other schools of architecture in the country. Central among them was the relation between poetry and architecture: the spoken word was considered central to any founding act sustained by architecture. Another key interest was the territory, and more specifically, the spatiality of South America. The School had continental ambitions, drawing its inspirations from Mexican historian Edmundo O’Gorman (brother of Juan O’Gorman, notable Mexican modern architect). Both the relation between poetry and architecture and the interest in territory would inform a series of creative processes and distinctive products that set the work of this school apart from its context.



Among the new methods put forward by Cruz and Iommi were the centrality of direct observation, the importance of sketches and notes produced in situ, en ronda creation (creation in a circle), and the phalène. The latter was invented by Iommi while living in Paris in 1955, and was defined as a poetic improvisation performed in public, with the participation of other artists and passers-by. All these methodological aspects, together with the importance of the collective and the territory, were put in practice through two very distinctive products/processes, perhaps the better-known outcomes of the Valparaiso School: the travesias and the Open City.



The travesias (voyages or journeys into the South American territory) were preceded by the poem Amereida (1967), which reflects upon a trip taken by some teachers and alumni between Patagonia and Bolivia, and Amereida II (1982). The first travesia as part of the academic syllabus was executed in 1984, and from then on followed one per year. Amereida III (1991) publishes the travesias made between 1984 and 1988, and a record of the subsequent journeys up to today can be found on the school’s website. These circular trips involve descriptive and creative activities, such as poem reading and the erection of light structures. The principles behind the travesias are the ‘thesis of our own north’ and South America as an ‘inland sea’; the interests are said to be political, with a focus on boundaries and frontiers.

The Open City was founded in 1970, after the creation of the Amereida Cultural Corporation, academically associated with the school but legally independent from it. The corporation acquired some land in the coastal area of Ritoque and, from then on, the Valparaiso School teachers and students subsequently engaged in the construction of particular structures and buildings. Notable amid the structures are the hospederias, or lodges, designed to host students and teachers, that provide the space for the kind of collective learning promoted by the school (Double lodge, 1974; Pie de Cruz, 1977; Design, 1977; Dormitory, 1978; Nail, 1980; Wanderer’s, 1981; Entrance, 1982; Study, 1987; Rosa de los Vientos, 1998; Garden, 1998; Signs, 2002). Together with these buildings, within the territory of the Open City, there are also a series of loose buildings (Igloo, 1971; Bathrooms, 1971; Music Room, 1972; Palace of Dawn and Dusk, 1983; House of Names, 1992; Beam Hall, 1992), agoras (Tronquoy, 1972; Guests, 1978), gardens (Bo Cenotaph, 1982), a cemetery (1976), a chapel (1999) and an amphitheatre (2001), plus a collection of sculptural structures (Water Tower, 1974; the Well, 1976).

All these elements (collectivism, poetry and architecture, territory, phalènes, Amereida, travesias, Open City) could be understood as an original interpretation of modernism as developed in Europe. Le Corbusier (an acknowledged referent), the Bauhaus and the Ulm School had a great influence over the Valparaiso School. ‘Life as art,’ the dissolution of authorship, a collective way of life and a common initial syllabus for art, design, and architecture were all traits that the Valparaiso School adopted from modernist initiatives stemming from Europe.

The Valparaiso School remains attached to the programme devised by Cruz and Iommi to this day, although some discussions have been undertaken to update the school’s identity since 2007. The school’s impact upon the profession and discipline of architecture in Chile is usually understood as anecdotal, mainly due to the disengagement from urban, social and technical issues that the school promoted. This disengagement, however, could be seen as a symptom of the general practice of architecture in the last third of the 20th century. The flight from the urban into landscape mirrors the withdrawal from the public into the private — the most representative figure of Chilean architecture being the house in the white mountain. The Valparaiso School, by retreating to the dunes and choosing the language of poetry, severed its links with the social.
