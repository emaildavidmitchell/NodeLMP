Marcus Garvey was a Jamaican political leader and a prominent figure in promoting Pan-Africanism. His work as a public speaker, publisher, and entrepreneur earned him a central role in the back-to-Africa movement of the 1920s. Garvey organized the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League in Jamaica in 1914 and shortly thereafter came to the US, where he established the Negro World newspaper. He became President of the short-lived Black Star line, an all-black shipping company operating from 1919-1922 with the goal of facilitating trade and transportation for black Americans to and from the African continent. Another venture, the Negro Factories Corporation, manufactured commodities to create and sustain the economic viability of the African diaspora in the global economy. With Liberia as a primary focus, Garvey pushed for the repatriation of Africa. While this project achieved mixed success and some controversy, the symbolic import of the UNIA-ACL cannot be overstated. It exemplified the strength of early Black Nationalism and the resolve of those struggling to address racial inequality and assert African identity.
