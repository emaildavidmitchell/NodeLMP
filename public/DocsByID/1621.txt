Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania is an experimental 82 minutes long colour film directed by Jonas Mekas. It documents the director’s and his brother Adolfas’ return to their native village of Semeniškai, Lithuania for the first time in 25 years.



The Mekas brothers had fled their village in 1944 trying to escape the war; however, they ended up in a German labor camp. After the end of the war they immigrated to the United States but had great difficulty establishing contact with their extended family that was now living under Soviet occupation.

Reminiscences functions as a meditation on exile and memory. Through his customary rhythmic cutting and lyrical voiceover, Mekas contrasts the scenes filmed in Brooklyn and the Catskills and those in Lithuania. The colors appear more vibrant in Semeniškai, which the film constructs as a space of suspended temporality. As Jonas and Adolfas rediscover their ancestral home, its flower filled garden and its cats, and meet their mother, siblings and uncles, the film’s rapid montage creates a sense of ecstatic joy. And yet a sense of temporal displacement coexists uneasily with the a-chronological space of memory - some familiar landmarks are gone and, as in a fairy tale, a forest sprouted where there was none before. The film’s recurring images of Mekas’ old mother reinforce its ultimately nostalgic tone.
