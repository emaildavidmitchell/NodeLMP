Strand, Paul (1890-1976)  					Word Count: 220



The modernist American photographer and filmmaker Paul Strand is known for photographic experiments with light and form—exemplified by Wall Street, New York (1915), which graphically depicts urban architecture—and as a founder of the radical cooperative group Photo League (1936-1951), which advocated photography as a means for political and social change. A student of documentarian Lewis Hine, Strand’s 1916 ‘street portrait’ Blind Woman, captured with a concealed camera, combines objectivity with a modernist composition.  Alfred Stieglitz devoted the final issues of Camera Work to Strand in 1917 (no. 49/50). Following World War I, Strand traveled to New Mexico, Maine, and Colorado, taking close-ups of objects and natural forms; later, he investigated architectural fragments and the natural landscapes. Stand’s films include Manhatta (1921), made with Charles Sheeler, which depicts New York City street life; Redes (The Wave) (1936), filmed while living in Mexico, which portrays Mexican fishermen; and Native Land (1942) which addresses American labor. In 1949, Strand immigrated to France. Seeking to capture the character of place, he pursued projects including Time in New England (1950), Tir a’Murain/Outer Hebrides (1962), Egypt (1969), and Ghana (1976). Strand was awarded a 1945 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Strand died in France in 1976.
