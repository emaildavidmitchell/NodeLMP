SHAH, Kundan (1947-)



Kundan Shah is an Indian film director and scriptwriter. A graduate of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), he directed one of the few comedies of the ‘New Cinema Movement’ in the 1970s and 1980s. Though not commercially successful during its first release, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983), with its absurdist amalgam of various forms of comedy (especially satire and silent-era slapstick, already in place in his graduate work Bonga), became a cult hit and a yardstick over the years against which new comedies are measured. It remains an anomaly even in the context of Indian Parallel Cinema with its pastiche-like, almost post-modernist approach taken up only by the late Pankaj Advani in films like Urf Professor (2001) and Sankat City (2010). After Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, Shah focused his attention on television, only occasionally directing films such as Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na (1993) or Kya Kehna (2000). Most famous among his TV work is the hugely popular sitcom Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi (1985) and the equally successful drama-comedy Nukkad (1986-1987); one might add Circus (1990) featuring a young Shah Rukh Khan and the TV film Police Station (1987), planned as a TV series, but shortened after running into censorship problems. On most of these series and films, Shah collaborated with other FTII graduates like Sudhir Mishra, Saeed Akhtar and Aziz Mirza and others eventually forming the production company Iskra.
