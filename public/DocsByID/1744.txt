Scorpio Rising (Kenneth Anger, 1963)

Alan Wright (University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand)

A cinematic reflection on the style and iconography of the biker
subculture, Scorpio Rising celebrates and satirizes speed and masculinity,
underlining their intense homoerotic allure and fascistic potential. The
film mixes raw documentary footage with highly stylized and choreographed
sequences showing bikers fixing their machines, idling about, dressing, and
primping up for a party. Anger incorporates into the film various found
materials combined in skilful montage: Lil Abner cartoons; scenes from a D-
grade film on the life of Jesus, from nazi rallies, and from Laslo
Benedeks The Wild One (filmed off the television screen); and photographs
of Marlon Brando and James Dean. The soundtrack is made up of pop
songsradio hits from 1962, when the film was madewhose lyrics often
provide an ironic counterpoint to the images. Despite its conciseness,
Scorpio has a considerable tonal range; it starts out seductive and
humorous, turning sinister and violent towards the end, with insinuations
of fascism, sadistic brutality, and fatal wipe-out. For its appropriative
aesthetic, masterful blend of music and visuals, and irreverent brashness,
Scorpio Rising anticipates much subsequent dissident audio-visual culture,
from punk to digital mash-ups.
