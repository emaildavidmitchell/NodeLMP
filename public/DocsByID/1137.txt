Literary Agents
Despite early resistance from publishers such as William  Heinemann,[i]  the
expansion of British and American literary  markets  between  1880  and  the
First World  War  rendered  the  services  of  a  shrewd  and  knowledgeable
literary agent necessary. This was  especially  the  case  for  authors  who
hoped to make a living from their literary income.  Agents  arranged  terms,
negotiated rights and  contracts,  assessed  markets,  and  placed  material
accordingly.  They  helped  navigate  the  mysteries  of   an   increasingly
fragmented print culture  field,  and  by  doing  so,  served  an  important
mediating role  between  publishers,  authors,  and  the  mercurial  reading
public at the turn of the twentieth century.
Historical Context:
From 1880 to 1914, the  publishing  industries  in  Great  Britain  and  the
United States underwent dramatic expansions and  reorganizations.  By  1900,
annual production of new books in Britain had climbed  to  nearly  6000,  up
from just  370  titles  a  century  before;[ii]  by  1914  this  figure  had
doubled.[iii] In the field of periodical production,  the  total  number  of
annually published titles, not including newspapers, more  than  tripledgrew
from 3,200 to over 10,000 by the start of the First  World  War.[iv]  During
the same period, the number of Post Office Directory listings  for  literary
agents in London rose from just 2-3  in  the  early  1880s  to  over  30  by
1913,[v] a ten-fold increase reflecting the industrys  growing  demand  for
skilled managers to facilitate and direct this  expanding  volume  of  print
and visual material.
Agents Role:
Knowing what would sell, in what market, and for how much,  literary  agents
maximized clients  financial  returns  and  crafted  literary  reputations,
while targeting constellations of readers through a bewildering  variety  of
new publishing options. By 1925, for example, agents often  negotiated  over
twenty-six different rights to a single property. These included  first  and
second  serial,   book,   reprint,   syndication,   translation,   dramatic,
cinematic, radio, and gramophone rights.  In  addition,  these  rights  were
frequently negotiated  for  British,  American,  Colonial,  and  Continental
markets simultaneously.[vi]
Key Literary Agents:
Established in 1875, the London firm of Alexander Pollock  Watt  &  Son  was
the oldest and most respected firm in the business. Watts  impressive  list
of celebrity  clients  included  Marie  Corelli,  Walter  Besant,  H.  Rider
Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, G.K.  Chesterton,  and  Arthur  Conan  Doyle.  The
firms preeminence was virtually uncontested  until  the  arrival  of  James
Brand Pinker in January  1896.  As  an  agent,  Pinker  famously  championed
artistically daring, but commercially  less  successful  authors  including,
and his clients included Oscar Wilde,  Henry  James,  Joseph  Conrad,  James
Joyce, and D.H. Lawrence. By contrast, Watt negotiated  many  of  the  early
twentieth centurys most lucrative  publishing  contracts,  including  those
for  Winston  Churchill,  Charles  Garvice,  and  the  Baroness  Orczy.  The
American agent Albert Curtis Brown opened offices in London in 1899, and  by
1905 was establishing himself  as  a  formidable  rival  to  both  Watt  and
Pinker. These three firms remained among the most  influential  agencies  in
Britain  and  the  United  States   throughout   much   of   the   twentieth
century.[vii]
