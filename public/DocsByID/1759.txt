SEN, Mrinal (May 14, 1923–) 

Mrinal Sen is a renowned Indian film director, closely associated with a group of filmmakers known as the Indian New Wave, or Parallel Cinema. Born in Faridpur, now Bangladesh, he moved to Calcutta in 1940. Although he began directing films in 1955, it was his 1969 film, Bhuvan Shome, that won him admiration in the halls of India’s independent art cinema. The film was revolutionary, first and foremost, in its cinematic form. It incorporates live footage, documentary-like filmmaking, along with fast editing and even a few animated sequences. The narrative of the film is quite simple; emphasis is given instead to progressive socialist ideas. In the first half of the 1970s, Sen’s films become more politically radical, glorifying violent demonstrations against the government. This tendency is visible in his Calcutta trilogy (Interview, Calcutta 71, and Padatik) and Chorus (1975), the latter earning its director the Silver Prize at the Moscow International Film Festival. In the latter half of the 1970s, Sen turned to more mainstream filmmaking. He has also directed a few documentary films, among them a film produced for BFI’s series on world cinema, And the Show Goes On - Indian Chapter (1999).
