A vital figure in Brazilian Modernism, the painter Tarsila do Amaral is best known for her mid-to late 1920s artworks produced between São Paulo and Paris. During this period she worked closely with her then husband, writer Oswald de Andrade, and created artworks that either evoked or inspired his art. Tarsila (as she is known in Brazil) began her artistic training in Brazil under traditional artists like Pedro Alexandrino (1917) following a period of artistic training in Europe. In 1920 she travelled to Paris to study at the famous Academie Julian with Émile Renard. When she returned to São Paulo, Tarsila met the agitators of the groundbreaking event Modern Art Week of 1922 (Semana de Arte Moderna de 1922), which had taken place earlier that year, and started the vanguardist and informal Group of the Five (Grupo dos Cinco) with painter Anita Malfatti and writers Mário de Andrade, Menotti del Picchia, and Oswald de Andrade. After familiarizing herself with the modernist project in Brazil, Tarsila decided to return to the French capital to receive further modernist instruction. In an effort to construct a modern image for her native country, the painter mixed local vernacular with avant-garde form, which she learned from Cubist painters like Fernand Léger.

Living in Paris, Tarsila and Oswald de Andrade had an intense exchange with the Parisian avant-garde, especially with the poet Blaise Cendrars who joined the couple in their 1924 trip to Brazil. Stimulated by their visit to colonial cities in the interior of the country, Tarsila focused her production on native and rural motifs painted with naïf colours. This period became known as her “Brazilwood phase” (“fase Pau-Brasil”, 1924-1928), a term coming from the title of Oswald de Andrade’s first manifesto (“Manifesto de Poesia Pau-Brasil”, 1924) and book of poetry (“Livro de Poesia Pau-Brasil”, 1925). Notable from the 1920s are Tarsila’s paintings, A Negra (1923), which, with its geometric background marks the beginning of the painter’s modern oeuvre, and Abaporú (1928), which literally means “man-eater” in local Tupy indigenous idiom, and gained notoriety for spurring the anthropophagous movement and inspiring Oswald de Andrade’s “Anthropophagous Manifesto” (“Manifesto Antropófago”, 1928). Works realized in 1928 and 1929 constitute her anthropophagic period.

During the 1930s, Tarsila’s style changed significantly. Her stylistic evolution was also accompanied by important changes in her private life: she and Oswald de Andrade divorced, and due to repercussions of the 1929 stock market crash in Brazil, Tarsila lost her fortune, which she obtained from coffee plantations in Brazil. At this time, Tarsila abandoned the experimental concerns she had during the 1920s, as well as her interest in Cubism and Surrealism; instead, she began to concentrate on social issues. Her stylistic shift during the 1930s reflected her newfound interest in socialism, which spurred her 1931 visit to Moscow, where some of her work was put on exhibit. Her painting, Workers (Operários, 1933), is her most celebrated piece following her stylistic shift. From 1936 until the 1956 Tarsila contributed regularly to the newspaper, Diário de São Paulo, in which she wrote primarily about art and artists in addition to relating her experience with the European avant-garde. Although Tarsila laid a definitive framework for Brazilian modernism, she was not broadly recognized until the 1960s when the Brazilian art market began to emerge. From the 1980s onward, Tarsila’s work was included in prominent surveys of Brazilian and Latin American art, in particular Art of the Fantastic – Latin America 1920-1987 (Indianapolis Museum of Art, 1987), Latin American Artists of the Twentieth Century (MoMA, 1993), and Tarsila Frida Amélia – Tarsila do Amaral, Frida Khalo, Amélia Peláez (Fundación “La Caixa”, Madrid, Barcelona, 1997).
