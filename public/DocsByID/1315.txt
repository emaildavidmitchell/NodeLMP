Montague, C(harles) E(dward) (1867-1928)
C.E. Montague was an Anglo-Irish commentator and drama critic for the
Manchester Guardian (now the Guardian) from 1890, just after his graduation
from the University of Oxford, until his retirement in 1925.  He was
respected as a critic and a literary stylist, and published two novels
before the Great War which dealt with the iniquities of the newspaper
industry (A Hind Let Loose, 1910) and Irish people and politics (The
Mornings War, 1913).  Shortly after the outbreak of war Montague dyed his
grey hair black to enlist at age 47 as an over-age volunteer (the limit was
44); he served in the trenches briefly before becoming an Intelligence
Officer behind the lines, in which role he conducted tours for
distinguished visitors and wrote official war articles.  Montague is best
known for his responses to the war, and Disenchantment (1922) revised his
post-war leader articles for the Guardian into an embittered narrative
about the failures of political and military leaders.  His short story
collection Fiery Particles (1923) contains some of his best work,
distilling wartime situations into barbed vignettes, and the war novel
Rough Justice (1926) sets his disenchanted view of the war within a
dissonant, idealistic and traditional bildungsroman framework.  He died of
pneumonia in 1928.
