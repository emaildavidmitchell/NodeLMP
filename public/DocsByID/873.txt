Ibrahim Hussein is one of Malaysia’s most internationally recognized artists. His early works are known for their realistic figuration, the most prominent of which are Pak Utih (1970) and My Father & The Astronaut (1970).  His works are influenced by Abstract Expressionsm, as apparent in his aerial views of semi-abstract figures, entangled and rolling in fluid. Noteworthy examples of this technique include Tumult (1969) and Lovers (1964). His later series Dance of Life (1982) and Red, Orange & Core (1984) feature heavy line work by graphic pens. These present an innate monumentality of interweaving fluid lines, engaging the viewer in a continuous journey of visual rhythm. 



Ibrahim Hussein also invented a technique called ‘Printage’ which combines printing techniques and collage. This technique is exemplified in his pieces Are You Alone Up There? (1969), Pak Utih (1970), My Father (1972), and Hari Ini Kita Dewasa (1975). Ibrahim Hussein has a body of work that spans more than half a century and has left an extraordinary legacy of paintings that revolve around his perceptions of life, humanity, his country, and his reflection of personal experiences throughout the years.

Ibrahim Hussein was born in 1936 in the village of Sungai Limau in Yan Kedah, and began his early education at the Singapore Nanyang Academy of Art in 1956. He resumed his studies at the Byam Shaw School of Drawing & Painting in London between 1959 and 1963. From 1963 to 1966 he furthered his studies at the Royal Academy in London. As his career advanced, Hussein travelled and exhibited widely throughout Europe, the United States and the Middle East. He was the first Malaysian artist to take part in the 35th Venice Biennale in 1970, and was given the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in 1997, in addition to receiving various honours in Central America. In 2007, the Malaysian Government awarded him with the Anugerah Tokoh Melayu Terbilang and he was bestowed the ‘Datuk’ title by three different royalties. A retrospective of Hussein’s works was displayed by the National Art Gallery of Kuala Lumpur in 1986. Hussein also founded the Ibrahim Hussein Museum and Cultural Foundation in the Langkawi which has since closed.  He died on February 19, 2009 at the age of 72.
