Ephraim Mojalefa Ngatane, Ephraim Mojalefa  (b. 1938, Maseru, Lesotho (then
Basutoland), South Africa  d. 1971, Soweto, Johannesburg, Gauteng (then
Transvaal), South Africa).

Born in 1938 in Maseru, Lesotho (then Basutoland), South Africa, Ephraim
Ngatane was a painter and jazz musician affiliated with the first
generation of modern black South African artists of the1950s and 1960s. He
received art instruction in watercolour and oil painting at the Polly
Street and Jubilee Centers where he later served as a teacher, developing
major talents, notably Dumile Feni, Louis Maqhubela, and Ben Macala.
Ngatane was a member of the Weekend Painters group initiated by Durant
Shilahli. Through this affiliation he rejected the romantic expressionism
advocated at Polly Street for a documentary realist approach. His later
work incorporated religious symbolism and also moved into abstraction.
Ngatanes work served as a model for a generation of artists depicting
African township life. In 1963 Ngatane held his first solo show at the
Adler Fielding Gallery, Johannesburg. He continued to actively exhibit work
until his untimely death at the age of 33. His work is featured in numerous
public and private collections, including the Pretoria Art Museum, the
William Humphreys Art Gallery, Kimberley, and the University of the
Witwatersrand Collection, Johannesburg. Ngatane died in 1971 in Soweto,
Johannesburg, Gauteng (then Transvaal), South Africa.
