	Toyen (1902 – 1980), born Marie Čermínová, was a young revolutionary who stirred the Czech avant-garde scene with her provocative imagination and erotic art. In addition to garnering public attention with sexually ambiguous pseudonym, Toyen was an inriguing figure because of her male dress and eccentric behavior. Toyen was a member of Devětsil, and was a lifelong surrealist and progresive artificialist. Her contact with Paris intensified after she founded the Surrealist Group of Czechoslovakia in 1934 and her associates received a visit from leading French figures André Breton and Paul Eluard in Prague in 1935. Toyen continued her artistic practice secretly during WWII and in 1947 she immigrated to Paris. Her work re-appeared on the Prague exhibition scene only in 1966. Upon the dismantling of the Surrealist Group of Czechoslovakia in 1969, Toyen retired and died alone in Paris in 1980.
