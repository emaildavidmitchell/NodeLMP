After meeting Holbrook Jackson in 1900, in 1903 the pair founded the Leeds Arts Club with the aim of furthering avant-garde ideas and philosophy. After moving to London in 1906, Orage and Jackson bought the defunct weekly magazine the New Age. Orage edited the magazine from May 1907-September 1922 and under his editorship the periodical became an influential arbiter of Modernist culture, Socialist politics, and contemporary philosophy, particularly the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche. After leaving the New Age in 1922, Orage travelled to France and New York before returning to England in 1930. In 1931 Orage founded a new periodical, the New English Weekly which he edited until his death in 1934.
