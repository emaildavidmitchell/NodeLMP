Rodolphe Mathieu (1890–1962) was pianist, composer and pedagogue and played a role too often ignored in the musical scene of his time. His music is rigorously composed and sensuously expressive, and its amazing boldness rivals the inventiveness of the European avant-garde. Many pieces reveal Mathieu’s chromatic lyricism, including his Quintet for piano and string quartet (1942) and his Trio for piano, violin and cello (1922). At the heart of this composer’s fairly short list of works lie a few pieces for voice, sometimes accompanied by instrumental groups such as a string quartet in Deux poèmes (1928) or an orchestra in Un peu d’ombre (1913) and Harmonie du soir (1924).
