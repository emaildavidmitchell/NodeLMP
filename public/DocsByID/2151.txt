Yorozu, Tetsugorô (萬 鉄五郎) (1885 - 1927 ) 



Yorozu Tetsugorô was a Yôga (Western-style) painter who was associated with the Avant-Garde movement of the Taishô years (1912 – 1926). His foray into art started early when he started studying Ôshita Tôjirô’s ( 大下藤次郎) A Guide to Watercolours. Prior to enrolling at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in Western-style painting, he was already attending meetings and study sessions at the Hakubakai (White Horse Society 白馬会 1896 – 1911). In 1907, he entered the Tokyo School of Fine Arts and graduated in 1912.  His graduation work, A Nude Beauty (1912) drew much attention and was thought to be the pioneering work of Japanese Fauvism. The work is designated today as an Important Cultural Property. Yorozu’s works around in this period showed the influence of both  Fauvism and Cubism. His landscapes and portraits were well-received at the Nikakai (Second Section Association, 1914- present) which was open to showcasing younger and more Avant-Garde artists’ works. Due to health reasons, he moved away from Tokyo to recuperate but he continued when possible to exhibit at the Nikaten, exhibitions of the Nikakai. Although he was unsuccessful at his attempts at the government-sponsored Teiten, Yorozu continued with his explorations in art, in Nanga (literati painting) and Nihonga (Japanese-style painting). He passed away in 1927 and left behind his greatest legacy of being known as Japan’s pioneer of Cubism and Fauvism.
