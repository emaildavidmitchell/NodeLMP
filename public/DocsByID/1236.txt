Mayakovsky, Vladimir (1893–1930)

(МАЯКОВСКИЙ, ВЛАДИМИР)

Mayakovsky, Vladimir Vladimirovich

Vladimir Mayakovsky (МАЯКОВСКИЙ, ВЛАДИМИР) was a leading Russian poet of the twentieth century and representative of Russian Futurism, a modernist trend that emerged as an attempt to approximate the utopian future through art. Mayakovsky brought experiment and innovation to poetry, drama, cinematography and graphic design, thus changing the entire palette of Russian art. 



He made his literary debut in 1912 as a co-author of the scandalous Russian Futurist Manifesto A Slap in the Face of Public Taste (Poshchechina obshchestvennomu vkusu). His concern with the flagrant social injustices of the time aggravated by World War I led him to write a trilogy of early programmatic poems culminating in A Cloud in Trousers (Oblako v shtanakh,1915). During this formative period, Mayakovsky met and fell in love with Lili Brik, a woman who would become his life-long muse and the personification of love, faith, and revolution in his oeuvre. The new aesthetic discourse he developed subsequently facilitated the poet’s passionate acceptance of the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 that promised to solve all of the tragic controversies of the past. After thirteen years of devoted service to the revolutionary ideals, he gradually became disappointed with the actual social and ethical outcomes of the revolution.

He made his literary debut in 1912 as a co-author of the scandalous Russian Futurist Manifesto A Slap in the Face of Public Taste (Poshchechina obshchestvennomu vkusu). His concern with the flagrant social injustices of the time aggravated by World War I led him to write a trilogy of early programmatic poems culminating in A Cloud in Trousers (Oblako v shtanakh,1915). During this formative period, Mayakovsky met and fell in love with Lili Brik, a woman who would become his life-long muse and the personification of love, faith, and revolution in his oeuvre. The new aesthetic discourse he developed subsequently facilitated the poet’s passionate acceptance of the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 that promised to solve all of the tragic controversies of the past. After thirteen years of devoted service to the revolutionary ideals, he gradually became disappointed with the actual social and ethical outcomes of the revolution. This disappointment, catalyzed by his unsettled personal life, contributed to his suicide in 1930. However, in his final poem At the Top of My Voice (Vo ves’ golos, 1930), Mayakovsky does not renounce his core revolutionary values, but rather projects their implementation into the distant future, thus remaining a Futurist poet from the beginning to the end.   



Mayakovsky is arguably one of the most prominent Russian authors of the twentieth century. A passionate supporter of Russia’s political transformation, he is also recognized for his tremendous role in the technical refinement and modernization of Russian literature.



Born in a province of the former Russian Empire, Mayakovsky grew up equally fluent in Russian and Georgian. This bilingualism likely contributed to his refined taste for the vocal aspect of poetry. Mayakovsky was only thirteen when his father died of an accidental infection. That loss appears to have led to a preoccupation with father figures (Alexander Pushkin, Vladimir Lenin, God) who both intimidated and attracted him. 



Mayakovsky’s unique poetic world emerged from the aesthetics of Futurism. The Futurists took art to the street, turning their poetic recitations into colourful, provocative and even scandalous performances. Mayakovsky was among the young avant-garde non-conformists who destroyed the comfortable automatism of art consumption by appearing in public with painted face or draped in a garish yellow shirt. He used unconventional rhythms and syntactic forms, neologisms and astonishing alliterations, merging the imagery of church rituals with the obscene vocabulary of the street. His talents as a graphic designer and actor were instrumental in the blending of disparate forms of art together. 



Mayakovsky enthusiastically greeted the October Revolution, confounding the Futurist artistic ideals with Bolshevik political thought and reflecting: ‘To accept or not to accept? There was no such problem for me or other Moscow Futurists. My Revolution!’ Later, Mayakovsky focused his creative energies on crafting propaganda posters for the Soviet telegraph agency (ROSTA), but his fusion of verse and visual forms, his witty and technically elaborate jingles set them apart from the primitive political propaganda of the day.

In 1923, Mayakovsky consolidated avant-gardist writers, designers, film directors and literary theorists under the banner of the LEF group (Left Front of Arts). This association and its magazine were designed to bring the Futurist agenda of ‘life-creation’ into line with post-revolutionary reality. In addition to the efforts of Mayakovsky, LEF promoted works by Viktor Shklovsky, Boris Pasternak, Velimir Khlebnikov, Sergei Eisenstein, Isaac Babel, and eventually fomented the development of Russian Formalism and Constructivism. 



Mayakovsky’s late plays The Bedbug (1928) and The Bathhouse (1929) bitterly ridiculed the degenerating class of Soviet bureaucrats. Both performances were notoriously ignored by the political and literary authorities, despite the fact that their artistic perfection was reinforced by Mayakovsky’s brilliant collaborators: Vsevolod Meyerhold, the director, and Dmitry Shostakovich, the composer. The same rejection followed his retrospective exhibition Twenty Years of Work (1929–1930), although it was designed to demonstrate his contribution to revolutionary art and to re-establish him as one of the founding fathers of Russian revolution. 

Meanwhile, his growing social isolation was worsened by problems in his personal life. A mundane quarrel with the beautiful married actress Veronika Polonskaya provided the immediate trigger for his suicide in April 1930 but was hardly the real cause. The poet’s drastic disillusionment is evident in his final poem At the Top of My Voice (1930), where post-revolutionary Russian reality is remorselessly characterized as ‘petrified crap’.  



Immediately following his death, Mayakovsky was blacklisted as a ‘bourgeois individualist’, but this changed after Stalin nominated him in 1935 as ‘the best, most talented poet of our Soviet epoch’. Soviet censorship stripped away much of his original vitality, technical ingenuity, and individualism to produce an emasculated version of Myakovsky’s poetry which then was forcefully reintroduced into the literary mainstream as a part of the Stalinist mythology. 



Mayakovsky’s legacy, though still surrounded by controversy, changed the artistic landscape of both Russia and the world. He continues to inspire new generations of authors, rock-singers, and film directors.
