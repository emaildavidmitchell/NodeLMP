VARDA, Agns (May 30, 1928)

Agns Varda is a French filmmaker and visual artist. She is best known as
the key female figure of the French New Wave. More recently, she has been a
pioneer of the documentary genre known as the essay film. Born in Brussels,
Varda began her career as a still photographer. Her first feature-film, La
Pointe Courte (1955), shot on a small budget in a French fishing village,
can be understood as a stylistic bridge between Italian Neo-Realism and the
French New Wave.  Her most important film, Clo de 5  7 (Clo from 5 to 7,
1962),  captures two hours in the life of a Parisian starlet as she awaits
the results from a cancer biopsy. The film is notable for its innovative
narrative structure, its treatment of existentialist themes, and its ground-
breaking study of modern feminine identity. <Image 1> In the late 1960s,
Varda and her husband, the director Jacques Demy, lived in Los Angeles,
where she befriended key figures of the California counterculture. Her 1985
film Sans toit ni loi (Vagabond) employed a Rashomon-like, multi-
perspectival structure to explore the final weeks of an enigmatic and
rebellious drifter, played by Sandrine Bonnaire. <Image 2> Vardas most
important recent film is the documentary-essay The Gleaners and I, shot on
an inexpensive camcorder, about the practice of scavenging. Vardas voice-
over suggests the film itself can be understood as an affectionate
collection of gathered scraps. <Image 3> Throughout her work Varda has
explored the relationship of the individual to society and the place of
intimacy, happiness, death, and chance encounters in contemporary culture.
