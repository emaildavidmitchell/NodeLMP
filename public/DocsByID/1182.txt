MALEVICH, KAZIMIR SEVERINOVICH
23 February 1879, Kiev, Ukraine, Imperial Russia
15 May 1935, Leningrad, USSR

Having begun to study with the Russian Impressionist, Fedor F. Rerberg, in
Moscow in 1906, Kazimir Malevich learned the colour theory and the craft of
Impressionist painting. By 1910 Malevich was painting in a bright Fauve
style and by 1912 he had mastered the structures of Parisian Cubism as well
as the depiction of Futurist movement in works such as Knifegrinder (1912).
The amalgamation of these two styles would be called Cubo-Futurism.
Between 1913 and 1915 Malevich did highly accomplished Cubist paintings,
his early 1915 canvases becoming increasingly dominated by planes of pure
colours floating over the Cubist contrast of objects. By the summer of 1915
Malevich was painting nothing but planes of colours in light on his
canvases, the works he called Suprematism   by which he meant the
domination of colour in light. He explored colour in light in his
paintings of 1916 to 1918 in several manners: using spinning discs, then
using projectors to cast rays of light onto a white screen of pure light.
This was followed by the discovery that spinning discs produce centrifugal
forces, calling his paintings, Supr[ematist] Construction of Colour where
construction refers to force. In 1918-1919 Malevich painted light
itself in his White on White canvases, to conclude with his Suprematism of
the Spirit, 1919-1920, a Suprematism of the Mind and of cosmic space. Out
of the modern trends, Malevich created a painting of pure colour and light,
pure non-objectivity and itself a leading modernist trend.

As a painter, Malevich contributed to the major avant-garde exhibitions in
Moscow and Petrograd between 1912 and 1920, exhibitions that documented his
extraordinary variety and mastery of Cubism, Futurism, and the innovations
of Suprematism. With the 1917 October Revolution, the arts institutions
were reorganised and Malevich, like many of his colleagues, introduced new
methods of teaching in art schools which were based on the modern artistic
trends of Cubism, Futurism, Suprematism and Constructivism. At the
Practical Art Institute in Vitebsk, 1919-1922, Malevich developed the
principles of these trends in the students, creating a modern consciousness
manifested by the modern trends  multiple points of view in Cubism,
dynamism in Futurism, static and dynamic non-objectivity and the cosmos in
Suprematism. Out of this Malevich developed a theory of creativity, of
artistic invention, which he continued to explore when in
Petrograd/Leningrad, 1923-1926. During these years he also applied the new
principles of pure plane and volume to the design of architecture, the
Arkhitektons, and to graphic design and porcelain. In the late 1920s
Malevich began to apply Suprematist principles to a figurative art of
peasants and workers in an attempt to align his painting with what would be
declared by Stalins 1932 decree that art is an instrument of propaganda.
Despite this, Malevich was arrested in 1930 on charges of being a
formalist, by which was meant influenced by Western, bourgeois styles of
Cubism and Futurism. His late paintings depict severely stylised but
realistic portraits.
