Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts

The Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts was established in 1980 by the Royal Society of Fine Arts, a private, non-profit, non-governmental organisation with the goal of promoting the visual arts in Jordan and the region. Located in two buildings in the historic district of Jabal al Weibdeh in the capital of Amman, the National Gallery houses over two thousand five hundred paintings, drawings, sculptures, ceramics, photographs, weavings, installations and video art by modern and contemporary artists of Arab, Islamic, and developing countries. One of the institution’s most important projects was the 1989 exhibition, Contemporary Art from the Islamic World, which opened at the Barbican Center in London. Accompanied by an extensive catalogue, edited by founding director Dr. Wijdan F. Al-Hashemi, the exhibition represented the most extensive show of modern Islamic art in Europe with over two hundred pieces and inclusive of over a hundred artists from twenty-three countries in the Islamic world. In 2009, the National Gallery launched a second pioneering project: the Mobile Museum. Each week, a van now converted into a gallery, shares the work of Jordanian artists along with art workshops and artist’s talks, with villages throughout Jordan’s rural countryside.
