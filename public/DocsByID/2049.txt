VOLOSHIN, Maximilian Alexandrovich (,  )
(1877-1932)

Poet, translator, and literary critic of the late Silver Age and early
Soviet era, whose best poems explore philosophical and historical subjects
and whose house in Koktebel became an important meeting place for poets
and intellectuals. Born in Kiev on May 28, 1887. As a child he moved to
Moscow with his mother, and later he studied at the Law Faculty at the
University of Moscow. He was suspended from the University several times
for participating in student-led demonstrations. After dropping out of
school, Voloshin traveled extensively through Europe, spending much of his
time in Paris. In April of 1906, he married Margarita Sabashnikova who was
one of his mentees and a fellow member of the Symbolist literary salons.
Their troubled relationship is the topic of many of Voloshins poems.  By
1911 Voloshin has moved to Koktebel in the Crimea where he developed his
own literary circle known as the Dacha Circle. During the Russian Civil
War, Voloshin served an appointment with the Red Army and acted as a
liaison between the Red and the White armies. After legally divorcing
Sabashnikova in 1927, Voloshin married his second wife Maria Zabolotskaia.
After the Revolution, Voloshin continued to conduct literary circles and
was instrumental in founding a Soviet dom otdykha for artists. He died in
Koktebel on November 8, 1932.
