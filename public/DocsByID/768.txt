Guiragossian, Paul (1925-1993, Palestine/Lebanon)

Born in Jerusalem to Armenian parents who had survived the 1915 Armenian
Genocide, Guiragossian eventually settled in Beirut after being evacuated
from Palestine by the British. Working as an illustrator, Guiragossian
began exhibiting during the 1950s. In 1956, he won first prize at a
painting competition and received a scholarship from the Italian government
to study at the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence. Two years later,
Guiragossian held his first solo exhibition at the Galeria DArte Moderna
La Permanente. In 1962, Guiragossian received a second scholarship from the
French government to study abroad at Les Ateliers des Maitres de lEcole de
Paris. Most recognised for his depiction of the human figure, his portraits
include a substantial number of compositions of his wife and children, self-
portraits, and anonymous figures. A significant number of pieces focus on
the tender embrace of mother and child. In what would become his
distinctive art form, Guiragossian uses long, vertical brushstrokes to
depict the bodies of his figures as abstracted and elongated so that the
imagery echoes of Byzantine and Christian icons. During the 1950s,
Guiragossian began producing complete abstract paintings. Applying bright,
bold color in blocks to the canvas, Guiragossian then left parts of the
surface untouched, in turn generating depth and movement through a creative
embrace of negative space.
