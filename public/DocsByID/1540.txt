Platonov, Andrei (1899-1951)

ПЛАТОНОВ, АНДРЕЙ

Born into the family of a railway worker, Andrei Platonovich Klimentov began publishing poetry and essays soon after the 1917 revolution, adopting the pseudonym Andrei Platonov, which was based on his father’s first name. Educated as an engineer, he worked extensively in hydrological projects in Voronezh and Tambov provinces. In 1927, Platonov published a debut collection of stories Epifanskie shliuzy (The Locks of Epifan) and moved to Moscow to pursue a career as a writer, contributing stories, novels, plays, screenplays and critical essays, most of which were written in an idiosyncratic style and conveyed an odd view of the world.

Though he firmly believed that his writing furthered the cause of Communism, and though he enjoyed high esteem among fellow writers, Platonov experienced long periods of official disfavor and was unable to publish his major works, the novels Chevengur (1929), Kotlovan (The Foundation Pit) (1930), Dzhan (Soul) (1935) and Schastlivaia Moskva (Happy Moscow) (1936?). He enjoyed a modicum of redemption with his stories during World War II and subsequent retellings of folklore in the late 1940s. His reputation has grown steadily since more of his works became accessible to readers, a process that began in the 1960s and continues to this day.

Andrei Platonov was an idiosyncratic writer who can be claimed equally by modernism and by socialist realism. Born into the family of a railway worker on the dusty outskirts of the south-western Russian city of Voronezh, Andrei Klimentov (his pseudonym Andrei Platonov was based on his father’s first name) began publishing poetry and philosophical essays soon after the 1917 revolution in the spirit of the Proletkult movement, which sought to create a new, working-class aesthetic. His writing career was interrupted by his education and work as an irrigation engineer, although he also published extensively on technical matters. In 1927 Platonov’s debut collection of stories Epifanskie shliuzy (The Locks of Epifan) was published and he moved to Moscow to pursue a career as a writer. Over the next decades Platonov forged a reputation as one of the sincerest and original voices in Soviet literature, but these very qualities made him a frequent target of ideological watchdogs, and many of his most significant writings were published only posthumously, some as late as the 1990s.



Platonov’s earliest writings reveal the deep influence of cosmism, a wildly speculative trend in Russian philosophy exemplified by the works of Nikolai Fedorov and Aleksandr Bogdanov, often coloured by the philosophical pessimism of Oswald Spengler and Vasily ROZANOV. Platonov’s early work in fiction bears the clear imprint of the neo-baroque style of Boris PILNYAK, with whom Platonov collaborated on a story and a play in 1928. The result of these disparate influences was an odd view of the world communicated in an idiosyncratic style, often via hard-done-by characters marked by a kind of holy foolishness. Platonov’s first run-in with officialdom came after his story ‘Usomnivshiisia Makar’ (‘Doubting Makar’) (1929), which presents a peasant’s dumbfounded view of socialist Moscow. Platonov was subject to an outright ban for several years after his 1931 documentary sketch ‘Vprok. Bedniatskaia khronika’ (‘For Further Use. The Chronicle of a Poor Peasant’), which allegedly attracted Stalin’s personal ire. With his uncomprehending characters and ambiguous narratives, Platonov is sometimes read as a satirist, but he seems to have believed sincerely and ardently that his writing was a constructive force in the advent of Communism (though his repeated attempts to win membership in the Communist Party appear to have been unsuccessful). Nonetheless, his first major novel Chevengur (1929) was published only in part, and while Kotlovan (The Foundation Pit) (1930) and Schastlivaia Moskva (Happy Moscow) (1936?) remained wholly unknown to readers until decades later. None of his many dramas has been staged; only one of his many screenplays was produced, but the film (Aina from 1930) has not survived. 



Platonov enjoyed a brief respite in the mid-1930s. In 1937 he published Reka Potudan’ (The River Potudan), a collection of new stories, and in 1938 the central newspaper Literaturnaia gazeta published fragments of his novel Dzhan (Soul). However, Platonov was soon in disfavour again, in part for his work on the theoretical journal Literaturnyi kritik, the intellectual leader of which was Georg Lukacs. A collection of critical essays Razmyshleniia chitatelia (Meditations of a Reader) was prepared for publication in 1939 but withdrawn at the last minute. Platonov enjoyed a modicum of redemption with his stories during World War II and subsequent retellings of folklore in the late 1940s, some of which were published in book form. His reputation has grown steadily since more of his works became accessible to readers, a process that began in the 1960s and continues to this day. Platonov is now widely recognized as one of the major Russian prose writers of the twentieth century.
