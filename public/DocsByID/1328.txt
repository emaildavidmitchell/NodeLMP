Muir, Edwin (1887-1959)

Born into an Orkney farming family which suffered a traumatic
transplantation to industrialised Glasgow in 1901, Edwin Muir came to
literary prominence with We Moderns (1918), a series of aphoristic essays
first published in A. R. ORAGEs New Age. The books success in America
resulted in a contract with the Freeman magazine which enabled him to
travel in Europe with his wife WILLA, thus making the contact with German
language and culture which resulted in their later translations of Kafkas
fiction. Muirs reputation in the 1920s was primarily as critic of the new
writing of T. S. ELIOT, JAMES JOYCE and VIRGINIA WOOLF in books such as
Transition (1926). Although his First Poems was published by Hogarth Press
in 1925, his mature contribution to modernist poetry came later in
collections such as The Labyrinth (1949) and One Foot in Eden (1956). His
autobiography (1954) is considered a classic of the genre. Muirs writings
made a significant contribution to SCOTTISH MODERNISM, although as an
Orkneyman he considered Scotland his second country. He is now increasingly
recognised for his European qualities.
