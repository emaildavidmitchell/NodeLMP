Takeuchi,  Seihô (  竹内栖鳳) (1864- 1942) 



Takeuchi Seihô was one of the most prolific Nihonga artists from the Kyoto painting world. Originally trained under Kôno Bairei (幸野楳嶺, 1884 – 1895) of the Maruyama-Shijiô school (円山四条), he excelled in depicting nature scenes and advocated sketching from life or shasei (写生) as the foundation of artistic practice. Seihô was also adept at Western-style painting that he experimented with upon returning from a six-month trip to Europe in 1901.  He had a diverse range of subject matter and styles, from Western landscapes, poetic ink paintings, decorative figure works to realistic animal paintings.  In his depictions of animals, it was said that he spent a long time observing them and capturing not only their likeness but also their psychological characteristics. Tabby Cat (班猫 1924), which is classified as Important Cultural Property, is a fine example of Seihô’s mastery and grasp of his subject. In 1937, Seihô was awarded the Order of Culture. In addition to his successful career as an artist, he was also a teacher who had profound influence on the next generation of Nihonga artists from Kyoto.
