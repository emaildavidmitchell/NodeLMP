Kolatkar, Arun (1932-2004)

Rajeev S. Patke

Kolatkar was a bilingual poet who wrote in English and Marathi, and also
worked as a graphic artist. He was one among several writers from mid-
twentieth century India to succeed in adapting a modernist outlook to his
times and circumstances. Born in Kolhapur into a middle-class Hindu family,
he studied art in Mumbai and worked most of his professional life in
advertising. Intensely private in nature and Bohemian by temperament, he
shunned publicity, read eclectically, published sporadically, and developed
the attitude of a flneur browsing the street-life of Mumbai. For many
years he frequented its humble cafes, and from such vantage points wrote
poems that provide a sardonic collection of marginalia on the cultural
transformations undergone by his corner of contemporary Asia, refracted
through a temperament impatient of cant, indifferent to bourgeois
attitudes, and skeptical of much that passes for tradition in India. His
work could be said to imply a search for values in a world where the
conventions and orthodoxies of the past no longer appeal or apply. It is
also of particular interest from the point of view of the theory and
practice of self-translation, given that he would write a poem in one
language, and then recreate it, concurrently, or many years later, in his
other language. Kolatkar practiced his unique form of bilingual creativity
without any apparent sense of cultural schizophrenia.

His writing is notable for its affinity for the vernacular tradition of
Bhakti (devotional) poetry in Marathi, from which he often translated. In
tone his poems can appear casual and almost inconsequential. Their laid-
back manner belies a seriousness of intent that can be scathing in satire,
unsparing in its honesty, and consistent in its sympathy for the underdog.
Their style keeps close to the rhythms and vocabulary of contemporary
speech. It is often spiced by locutions typical of contemporary Mumbai.
Their humor is of the laconic kind, clear-eyed and dry. The writing is
sharp in its distaste for all forms of social totalization, including those
perpetrated in India by casteism and Brahminism. Early work in Marathi was
collected in Arun Kolatkarchya Kavita (Arun Kolatkars Poems, 1977). The
same year he won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize for a volume in English,
Jejuri (1976). Its loose sequence constitutes a kind of pilgrims progress
for agnostics. A visit to a temple mixes myth and skepticism in noting the
dereliction of religion amidst a thirst for a need once fulfilled for many
by religion. Kolatkar worked for many years on the Marathi versions, and
they were finally published in book form in 2011.

In 2003 and the final year of his life, decades of apparent silence were
followed by a spate of books in both languages: four in Marathi and one in
English. These appeared just as the poet succumbed to stomach cancer. They
add to the historical scope and range covered by his work, especially in
Marathi, which engages more intensively than the work in English with the
critical residue of his cultural inheritance. Long admired by a small
circle of friends and writers, his books had circulated during his lifetime
from Mumbai and Pune. Posthumously, his reputation has become
international. The belatedness of this recognition is ironic, given the
tension in his career between reticence and the impulse to create, between
the urgency to share a unique perspective on experience and his acute
wariness about the likelihood of complicity with the culture industry.
