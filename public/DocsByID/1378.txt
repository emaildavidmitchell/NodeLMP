New Age, The

The NEW AGE was a weekly British literary magazine published from 1894-1938. Established by Frederick A. Atkins in October 1894, the NEW AGE originally existed as ‘A Weekly Record of Christian Culture, Social Service, and Literary Life.’ After brief editorial stints by A. E. Fletcher and Arthur Compton-Rickett, Joseph Clayton edited the magazine from 1898-1907. After G .B. SHAW provided funding, A. R. ORAGE and Holbrook Jackson purchased the magazine with the aim of using it to promote the ideas of FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE and FABIAN SOCIALISM. The pair edited the magazine together from May-December 1907. From January 1908-September 1922 ORAGE was the magazine’s sole editor. Under ORAGE, the NEW AGE became a highly influential platform for the latest ideas in modern literature, art, and philosophy and achieved a peak circulation of 22,000 copies per week. Its contributors included EZRA POUND, KATHERINE MANSFIELD, T. E. HULME, ARNOLD BENNETT and G. K. Chesterton. After ORAGE left the magazine, it was edited by Arthur Moore (1922-3) and Arthur Brenton (1923-38).
