Ortiz, William (1947--)

Marysol Quevedo

Born 30 March 1947, Salinas, Puerto Rico

Puerto Rican contemporary classical composer.

Although Ortiz was born in Salinas, Puerto Rico, he was raised in New York City. He studied composition at the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico under Héctor Campos Parsi and Amaury Veray. He has a master’s degree from SUNY at Stony Brook (1976), where his professors included Billy Jim Layton and Bülent Arel, and a PhD from SUNY at Buffalo (1983), with Lejaren Hiller and Morton Feldman as his professors. Ortiz served as assistant director of Black Mountain College II, NY, also teaching composition and music theory. He has also held the position of chair of the department of humanities, and has served as band conductor for the University of Puerto Rico at Bayamón, currently serving as music professor at this institution. As a music critic he has contributed to The San Juan Star. Among his many works he has completed commissions for the Casals Festival, the Guitar Society of Toronto, the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra, and the New York State Council of the Arts. 

Ortiz’s approach to composition is characterized by an eclectic adoption of popular and urban music genres as part of his compositional palette. Early on he incorporated elements from urban street music, found mostly in the Latino and Black neighborhoods of New York City, and in the poorer neighborhoods of San Juan, as reflected in Street music (1980), Graffiti Nuyorican (1983), De Barrio Obrero a la Quince (1986) and Bolero and Hip-Hop en Myrtle Avenue (1986). In these works we can hear Ortiz’s intention to bring the noise and sounds of the street into concert music. As his career progressed he broadened the palette of musical influences to wider popular and traditional Puerto Rican and Latin American musics found beyond urban centers.
