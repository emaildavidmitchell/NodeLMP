Painter, etcher, and illustrator John Sloan was a leading figure in the Ashcan School, a group of turn-of-the-century urban realists who used dark palettes and heavy brushwork to paint the grittier side of New York life. In 1892, while working as an illustrator at the Philadelphia Inquirer, Sloan enrolled in evening classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and co-founded the Charcoal Club, a group of local artists who met for informal discussions and sketching sessions in Robert Henri’s studio. Sloan followed Henri to New York City, where he became associated with ‘The Eight.’

Sloan followed Henri to New York City, where he became associated with ‘The Eight.’ Later in his career Sloan painted nudes and portraits as well as city scenes and landscapes in the art colonies of Gloucester, Massachusetts, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. While he struggled through much of his career to gain patrons for his work, Sloan’s New York scenes are now considered among the most important in American art. In 1939 a book of Sloan’s theories was compiled by his student Helen Farr, titled Gist of Art. Farr was responsible for the preservation and promotion of Sloan’s works and archive after his death in 1952.
