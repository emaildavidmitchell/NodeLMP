The Lost Generation
The Lost Generation is a group of expatriate American writers who came of
age during World War I and subsequently became prominent literary figures
following the war. The term can also be used to refer to the whole of the
post-World War I generation. The term was coined by Gertrude Stein in a
comment to Ernest Hemingway in which she declared, You are all a lost
generation. Hemingway subsequently used this phrase as an epigraph to his
novel The Sun Also Rises (1926) which is often seen as emblematic of the
lost generations literary tradition. This generation was lost because of
the alienation they felt for American culture and the fact that the values
they had grown up with no longer functioned in a post-World War I world.
The group of writers associated with the Lost Generation includes Ernest
Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, e.e. cummings, Sherwood
Anderson, Malcolm Cowley, Gertrude Stein, and Djuna Barnes.
