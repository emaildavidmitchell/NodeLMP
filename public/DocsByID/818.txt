Heidenstam, (Carl Gustaf) Verner von (1859-1940)

|Verner von Heidenstam was a Swedish poet and prosaist  |[pic]          |
|whose name is closely associated with modern Swedish   |               |
|nationalism. He is counted among the most influential  |               |
|advocates of the conservative movement throughout early|               |
|Swedish modernism and was also attacked by Strindberg  |               |
|during the famous Strindberg Feud. The national        |               |
|romantic tendencies in his literary works, as well as  |               |
|their idealistic historicism, stand in sharp contrast  |               |
|to the realistic, socio-critical slogans of the 1880s. |               |
|As of 1912, Heidenstam was a member of the Swedish     |               |
|Academy, and in 1916 he received the Nobel Prize in    |               |
|Literature. In 1910 he acquired the manor vralid in   |               |
|the south of Sweden where he died in 1940.             |               |


Verner von Heidenstam was the son of a  wealthy,  aristocratic  family  from
the county of rebro. In 1888 he debuted  his  first  collection  of  poems,
Vallfart och vandringsr, inspired by his early educational journeys to  the
Middle East. The poems convey a characteristic touch of  oriental  exoticism
and an enjoyment of life which breaks with  the  socio-critical  realism  of
the 1880s. The same can be said of his  first  novel,  Endymion,  where  the
Decline of the  East  motif  is  developed.  In  his  second  novel,  Hans
Alienus, verse and prose are  intermixed  and  the  praise  of  hedonism  is
evident. Heidenstams intense engagement with Swedish cultural  history  and
heritage is reflected in some of his most popular  works:  Karolinerna  (The
Charles Men) is a series of historical sketches about King Charles XII,  the
two volumes of Folkungatrdet (The Tree of the Folkungs) tell the  tales  of
medieval Swedish clans and chieftains, and Svenskarna  och  deras  hvdingar
(The Swedes and Their Chieftains) was published as a history book for  young
students. Moreover, Heidenstam  wrote  several  polemic  pamphlets  and  his
Renssans-manifesto from 1889 had considerable influence  on  the  aesthetic
debate of his time.

Verner von Heidenstam was married three times: first to Emilia  Uggla,  then
to Olga (Mathilda) Wiberg, and thirdly, to Greta (Anna  Margareta)  Sjberg.
From 1916 until his death he lived with Kate  Bang.  After  1915  Heidenstam
basically ceased writing poetry. He was severely  criticized  for  his  pro-
German attitude during the 1930s.
