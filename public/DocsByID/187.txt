Benavente, Jacinto (1866-1954)





Jacinto Benavente y Martínez was a Spanish dramatist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Author of more than 170 plays, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1922. His selection raised controversy, since many argued that the Generación del 98 and modernist writers such as Miguel de Unamuno, Ramón del Valle-Inclán, and Rubén Darío had greater merits. Nevertheless, Benavente had a significant and revitalizing influence on Spanish drama, ushering in a shift from melodramatic verse to prose comedy and favoring subtle dialogue over the impulsive action typical of the dramas of José de Echegaray.

Known primarily for his comedies set in urban locales, he also authored several successful rural dramas, one of which, Señora Ama, was said to be his favorite work. His most famous plays are Los intereses creados [The Bonds of Interest, 1907], a brilliant satire of the business world and hypocritical human nature that combines the Italian commedia dell’arte style with classical drama, and La Malquerida [The Passion Flower, 1913], a rural tragedy on the theme of incest. The latter was his most successful play.

Inspired by André Antoine’s Théâtre Libre in Paris, Benavente founded the Teatro Artístico in Madrid in 1899, working in collaboration with the modernist writer Ramón del Valle-Inclán in an effort to renovate dramatic production. The writers had a falling-out after an argument at a literary gathering, which led Benavente to organize his own gatherings, separate from those of Valle-Inclán.



Politically, Benavente’s life was marked by contradictions: he first supported the Republican cause during the Civil War but later favored the dictatorial regime of Francisco Franco, which facilitated the staging of his works. Benavente’s waning renown after his death is directly related to the disappearance of the audience he once targeted: the bourgeoisie.
