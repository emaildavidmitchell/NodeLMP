Luchino Visconti (1906  1976)

Luchino Visconti (Luchino Visconti di  Modrone,  Count  of  Lonate  Pozzolo.
Milan, 2 November 1906  Rome, 17  March  1976),  was  an  Italian  theater,
opera and cinema director, and a scriptwriter. Visconti began his career  in
1936 in Paris, as a director and costume assistant for Jean Renoir. Here  he
got closer to leftist  positions,  coming  into  contact  with  anti-fascist
militants and leftist intellectuals, such as the writer  and  director  Jean
Cocteau. In the  1940s  Visconti  settled  in  Rome,  where  he  joined  the
Communist party (to which he remained bound for the rest of  his  life)  and
began to collaborate with the journal Cinema. In 1942, with  Pietro  Ingrao,
Mario Alicata, and Giuseppe De Santis, he realized Ossessione, based on  the
1934 James Cain novel The Postman Always Rings Twice. Although  Rossellinis
Rome Open City (1945) is generally considered to be the  founding  movie  of
Italian neorealism, for many  critics  Viscontis  Ossessione  (1942)  is  a
precursor of the movement, depicting a bleak and hopeless world.

In 1945 Visconti worked on Giorni di Gloria, a film-documentary on the Nazi-
fascist occupation of Italy, and in 1948 he  wrote  and  directed  La  terra
trema. The latter is an adaptation of Giovanni Vergas  novel  I  Malavoglia
(1881) and is centered on the story of a family of Sicilian  fishermen.  The
film echoes Antonio Gramscis concern with the southern question  and  his
call for a new national alliance between different  popular  sectors.  After
several years dedicated to the theater, Visconti returned to the big  screen
with Bellissima (1951). This story  of a plebian woman whose  dream  is  to
turn her child into a future star  offered,  like  Siamo  donne  (1953),  a
look behind the scenes of the film world. With Senso (1954),  an  adaptation
of the 1882 novel by the Italian writer Camillo Boito, taking  place  during
the 19th century Italian Risorgimento, Visconti distanced himself  from  the
neorealist path, combining realism and romanticism. In the years  following,
Visconti returned to the opera and  directed  Maria  Callas  in  Verdis  La
traviata and Bellinis La Sonnambula.  In 1957,  continuing  the  series  of
great literary adaptations, Visconti completed Le  notti  bianche,  inspired
by Dostoevskys White Nights. In 1960 he  returned  to  neorealist  features
with Rocco e i  suoi  fratelli,  the  tragic  story  of  a  Southern  family
migrating to Milan in search of fortune. Its  violence  and  crudity,  along
with Viscontis political opinions, prompted harsh criticism  of  the  film,
but it was still awarded the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

After Rocco e i suoi fratelli, Viscontis next major film was Il  Gattopardo
(1963), which reinterpreted Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusas 1958 novel  about
the decline  of  the  Sicilian  aristocracy  at  the  time  of  the  Italian
Risorgimento. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the  16th  Cannes  Film  Festival,
the film established Viscontis fame in Europe and  the  United  States.  In
1965, Visconti received the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for  the
nocturnal film Vaghe stelle dellorsa. Inspired  by  Sofocles  Electra  and
Gabriele DAnnunzios novel Forse che s, forse  che  no  (1910),  the  film
depicts the incestuous  relationship  of  Giovanni  and  Sandra.  Two  years
later, with Lo straniero (1967), Visconti readapted, via a sort  of  oneiric
realism, a classic of existentialist literature, Camus  The  Stranger,  but
the movie did not meet much success.

La caduta degli Dei (1969), which echoes Thomas Manns Buddenbrooks  (1901),
is the first movie of Vicontis German Trilogy; the  trilogy  also  includes
Morte a Venezia (1971) and Ludwig  (1973)  and  intertwines  the  themes  of
beauty and death. At the end of the shooting of  Ludwig,  the  director  was
hit by a stroke that left the left side of his body paralyzed.  Despite  his
state, he directed his last two films, the  openly  autobiographical  Gruppo
di famiglia in un interno (1974), and L'innocente (1976), an  adaptation  of
Gabriele DAnnunzios novel of the same title (1892). Visconti died  in  the
spring of 1976 from a severe thrombosis.
