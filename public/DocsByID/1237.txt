Born in Clifton, Kansas, McAlmon moved frequently with his family and on his own, finding literary connections in Greenwich Village, where he first funded and edited Contact magazine with William Carlos Williams. He entered into a marriage of convenience with the lesbian writer Bryher (Annie Winifred Ellerman), affording them both financial security, establishing himself in Paris, where he was in close contact with many of the primary figures of the modernist movement, including a personal friendship with James Joyce (for whom he typed parts of Ulysses). He returned to the United States in 1940, dying (relatively unknown) in Desert Hot Spring, California, author of more than ten volumes of poetry, short fiction and autobiography.



Mostly considered a marginal figure in literary modernism, McAlmon still provides significant points of impact in discussions of modernist publishing, patronage and literary networks, most regularly recalled for his memoir, Being Geniuses Together (1938, though heavily revised and expanded by Kay Boyle, 1968) and for his publishing of Contact Editions. Works published under this imprint included many of his own books (his novel was the best received of these), but also significant volumes by Pound, Williams, H. D., Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes, Ernest Hemingway, Ford Madox Ford and Gertrude Stein, as well as one of the earliest fragments from Joyceâ€™s Work in Progress.
