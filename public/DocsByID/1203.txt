José Carlos Mariátegui was the most influential Latin American Marxist of the twentieth century. From 1914 to 1920 he worked as a journalist in Lima, Peru. Persecuted by the government, he traveled to Europe in 1920, where he studied Marxism in depth as a result of contact with socialist artists and intellectuals. In 1923 he returned to Peru persuaded of the importance of implementing socialism in the country. However, rather than following a European pattern, he developed a national variant of socialism that combined Marx’s ideas with the communal collectivism of indigenous culture.

In 1923 he returned to Peru persuaded of the importance of implementing socialism in the country. However, rather than following a European pattern, he developed a national variant of socialism that combined Marx’s ideas with the communal collectivism of indigenous culture. He saw in Andean collectivism a form of primitive communism useful for developing a Marxist revolution in a region with a small proletariat. His journal Amauta (1926-1930) was key for spreading his ideas as well as for opening a debate on socialism and culture in Peru and other countries. His most influential work, Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality (1928), is a materialist study of Peruvian society considered a fundamental text of Indigenismo.
