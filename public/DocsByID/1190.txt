Mandel, Eli (1922-1992)

Elias Wolf

Eli Mandel was a Canadian poet, anthologist, professor, and literary critic. He was born into a Russian-Jewish family and grew up on the Prairies during the Depression. After serving in the army during WWII, he earned a BA (1949) and MA (1950) from the University of Saskatchewan and a PhD from the University of Toronto (1957). He authored nine volumes of poetry, edited numerous anthologies, and published two volumes of literary essays, Another Time (1977) and The Family Romance (1986). His first collection was published alongside work by Gael Turnbull and Phyllis Webb in Trio in 1954.

His first collection was published alongside work by Gael Turnbull and Phyllis Webb in Trio in 1954. It demonstrates the interest in classical and biblical myth, the Canadian West, and the tension between order and openness that characterizes much of his work, particularly Fuseli Poems (1960). Mandel was awarded the Governor General’s Award for An Idiot Joy (1967). His interest in myth and archetype marks him out as a Canadian mythopoeic modernist poet, along with Jay Macpherson, James Reaney, Anne Wilkinson, and Margaret Atwood. Mandel’s criticism has, like Atwood’s, been labeled mythic or thematic. Mandel’s work is invested in the idea that words create the world, and that art is an act of social intervention and transformation.
