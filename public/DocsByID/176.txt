Samuel Barclay Beckett is widely considered one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Born in Ireland and living in France for half of his life, he wrote prose, dramatic works, poems, and criticism in both English and French. He started to write fiction after he met James Joyce and other intellectuals in Paris in the 1920s. His research on languages, literature, and philosophy at Trinity College, Dublin, and at École Normale Supérieure provided a solid basis for his works. His popularity grew rapidly after the Second World War, particularly after the publication of his groundbreaking play, En attendant Godot (1953, Waiting for Godot), and his trilogy, Molloy (1951), Malone meurt (1951, Malone Dies), and L’innommable (1953, The Unnamable). He was not only a prolific modernist who innovated avant-garde prose, theatre, radio, television, and cinema; he also joined the French Resistance during the Second World War and the post-war reconstruction. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969.

Samuel Barclay Beckett was born to Bill Beckett, a quantity surveyor, and May Beckett (Maria Jones Roe), a nurse, at Cooldrinagh in Foxrock, Dublin. The true date of his birth is debatable, though the public records show that he was born on Good Friday, 13 April 1906. He was the second son in a Protestant family, a quiet and thoughtful child who loved collecting stamps. At the age of fourteen, he was sent to Portora Royal School where he began to reveal his talent for language and sports.

In 1923, Beckett began to study at Trinity College, Dublin, for the bachelor’s degree in Modern Languages. Besides studying for his Honours subjects, French and Italian, he kept up Latin and completed two years of English literature courses. He read European literature widely and often went to theatres. His early novel Murphy (1938) reveals the shadow of the Abbey Theatre and some of J. M. Synge’s tragicomic elements. Beckett completed the bachelor’s degree in 1927.

In 1928, Beckett went to the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. His stay in Paris led to his meeting with James Joyce, Thomas MacGreevy (who later became Beckett’s confidant), and other intellectuals. Through MacGreevy, Beckett became a research assistant for Joyce’s ‘Work in Progress’ (later Finnegans Wake) and was invited to write an essay for Our Examination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress. This essay, entitled ‘Dante … Bruno. Vico .. Joyce’, is one of Beckett’s most important pieces of criticism. It was published together with his first short story, ‘Assumption’, an innovative fiction about the impulse of screams, in the magazine transition in June 1929. The following year, the Hours Press published Beckett’s first poem, ‘Whoroscope’. This long poem has ninety-eight lines, and smartly alludes to the life of Descartes. Soon after this publication, Beckett completed Proust, a critical study of Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time) along with a discussion of Schopenhauer’s philosophy.

Beckett continued to write fiction after he returned to lecture at Trinity in 1930. Due to his estrangement from his mother, among other reasons, he resigned from Trinity and went to Paris in 1932. He stayed at the Trianon Palace and spent most of his time writing his first novel, Dream of Fair to Middling Women (whose title was partly borrowed from Tennyson’s A Dream of Fair Women). The novel tells the story of Belacqua (a name in Dante’s Purgatorio) and his relationship with three women, the Smeraldina-Rima, the Syra-Cusa, and the Alba. Using very sophisticated language, Beckett wove many quotations from literary works, philosophy, and theology into an incoherent narrative structure. The novel was rejected by publishers and only published posthumously in 1992.



After his father’s death, Beckett was overcome with grief and left for London in 1933. The London years from 1933 to 1936 witnessed the publication of Beckett’s short story collection More Pricks than Kicks (1934), and the completion of his novel Murphy. During his stay in London, Beckett also underwent psychotherapy and was exposed to psychological studies through his therapist Bion and C. G. Jung’s lectures, as well as through reading Freud, Adler, and the Külpe School. Much of Beckett’s knowledge about psychology appeared in Murphy, a novel that he finished in 1936 but did not publish until 1938. Set in London, Murphy deals with a tragicomic hero Murphy who struggles to find jobs and maintain his relationship with a prostitute named Celia. The novel ends with the death of Murphy in a mental hospital. In the same year of the completion of Murphy, Beckett travelled to Germany and recorded his experience in six notebooks—the ‘German diaries’ as critics have called them. Between 1936 and 1937, Beckett was widely exposed to German literature and visual art. At the same time, he witnessed Hitler’s purge of modern art. 



After his permanent settlement in Paris in 1937, he was near-fatally stabbed by a pimp. In the process of recovery, Beckett not only received help from Joyce, but also met Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumesnil, who later became his life partner (and wife in 1961). Beckett and Suzanne joined the French Resistance in 1941 when France was invaded. After their cell was betrayed, they had to leave for Rousillion, a southern village in France. Beckett worked on a farm and continued to write his novel Watt, begun earlier in Paris. Watt marked Beckett’s further departure from his early works such as Dream of Fair to Middling Women and Murphy, as well as from the influence of Joyce’s writing. Watt features a character called Watt, who mysteriously appears at a railway station, goes through a series of events in Mr. Knott’s house, and disappears again. The excessively mathematical representation in this novel stresses Beckett’s mockery of rationality that had been revealed earlier in his ‘Les deux besoins’, an essay written in 1938 but unpublished until 1983 in Disjecta.

After the Second World War, Beckett and Suzanne returned to Paris and joined the Irish Red Cross hospital set up in Saint-Lô. The devastating scene of the heavily bombed Saint-Lô shocked Beckett. His radio speech in 1946, entitled ‘The Capital of the Ruins’, shows his sympathy for the people in Saint-Lô. The post-war years, from 1946 to 1953, witnessed the completion of Beckett’s several most significant works: the trilogy (Molloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable) and Waiting for Godot.

Written in four months in 1946, Mercier et Camier was Beckett’s first novel in French and it largely prefigured Molloy. In the same year, Beckett approved the French translation of Murphy and a contract for future works both in English and French, which officially marked the beginning of Beckett’s bilingual writing career. In the following three years, Beckett worked strenuously on the trilogy in French: Molloy (1951), Malone meurt (1951), and L’innomamable (1953). The French editions were followed by Beckett’s own English translations published in 1955, 1956, and 1959. Molloy contains two chapters, dealing with two main characters, Molloy and Moran, respectively. It begins with Molloy’s first-person narrative about his experience on the way to his mother’s apartment. When Molloy ends up staying in a ditch at the end of the first chapter, Moran, a detective in the second chapter, launches his search for Molloy. Malone Dies constructs a tension between Malone’s experience in a room and his growing difficulty in narrating his stories. Main characters in Malone’s stories change from Sapo to Macmann, along with Moll and other minor characters. In The Unnamable, the anonymous narrator claims the authorship of several characters from Beckett’s previous works, such as Murphy, Mercier, Molloy, Malone, and Macmann. The consistent use of ‘m’ for names implies a lasting desire to return to the absent matrix—the ‘mahood’ as the narrator calls it. The Unnamable does not have a fixed plot or setting. Its intractable narrative ends with the famous sentence, ‘You must go on, I can’t go on, I’ll go on’. The trilogy demonstrates Beckett’s unique style of writing and his interrogation of narrative and language.

Beckett’s most well-known work, the play En attendant Godot (Waiting for Godot), was written between 1948 and 1949 when he was working on the trilogy. Although Beckett’s turn to theatre began as early as 1947 when he completed a play called Eleutheria, Waiting for Godot was chosen by Beckett and the director Roger Blin as Beckett’s first play performed in the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris. According to Beckett himself, Waiting for Godot was partly inspired by Caspar David Friedrich’s painting, Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon. The play has two acts; in each act two main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, wait for Godot to come. In each act, they encounter three characters, Pozzo, Lucky, and a boy, but Godot does not appear at all throughout the play. This play shows Beckett’s effort to extend the possibility of theatre to a new level and to challenge the conventions of drama.

The 1950s and 1960s continued to witness Beckett’s success in dramatic works, such as Fin de partie (1957, Endgame), Fragment de théâtre I (Rough for Theatre I), Fragment de théâtre II (Rough for Theatre II), Krapp’s Last Tape (1958), Happy Days (1962), and shorter prose. In 1969, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature, though he was not particularly interest in awards and public attention. Beckett first turned to radio plays in 1956 when he wrote All That Fall for the BBC. In the 1970s and the 1980s, Beckett further extended his dramatic works to teleplays for the BBC and continued writing prose, such as The Lost Ones, Company, Ill Seen Ill Said, and Worstward Ho. ‘Stirrings Still’, written in 1986, is his last major work of prose. Although writing was considerably difficult for Beckett at that time, he insisted on translating it into French. He died peacefully on Friday, 22 December 1989.
