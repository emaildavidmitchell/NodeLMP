Jules Laforgue is one of the French ‘poètes maudits’ of the late 19th century. Maintaining a certain distance from literary movements, he developed a unique style, mixing the expression of pain with humor and sometimes satire. Often compared to Tristan Corbière, he is considered a Symbolist for his mysticism and the use of free verse, especially in his Derniers vers (1890). He is also a precursor of the Fantaisistes for the oral character of his poetry. Jules Laforgue takes part in international Modernism thanks to his interest in urban transformations and because of his impact on Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. His poetry, influenced by Walt Whitman (whom he translated) and by Verlaine, is known for its spleen (Les Complaintes,1885). The short stories of Les Moralités légendaires (1887) rewrite legends such as those of Salomé or Hamlet. Born in Montevideo in a Breton family, he was quickly recognized in French literary circles and published in Symbolist reviews such as La Vogue. He was especially close to Paul Bourget, Gustave Kahn, Félix Fénéon and Jean Moréas. Thanks to them, he obtained a position as private reader for the Empress Augusta in Berlin. Afflicted with consumption, he returned to Paris where he died at the age of 27, thus perfecting his image as melancholic poet.
