Altman, Robert (1925  2006)


Vivian Zenari (Athabasca University)

Robert Bernard Altman (20 February 1925, Kansas City, Missouri20 November
2006, Los Angeles) was an American director of television, theatre, and,
most famously, films, including MASH, Nashville, The Player and Gosford
Park. Altmans films are characterized by satire, social criticism,
fragmented storylines, and indefinite endings. These encourage
consideration of Altman as a modernist (or postmodernist) auteur. Robert T.
Self (2002) argues that Altman was among those American filmmakers who in
the 1960s and 1970s applied a modernist sensibility to genres such as
romance (A Perfect Couple (1979)), westerns (McCabe & Mrs Miller (1971)),
and science fiction (Quintet (1979)). These films demonstrate modernisms
taste for ambiguity, contradiction, and paradox. They reject the tendency
toward resolution and closure typical of genre films. Similarly, The Long
Goodbye (1973), Altmans adaptation of Raymond Chandlers hard-boiled
detective novel of the same name, re-imagines film noir (arguably a
modernist mode) and thus raises questions about the stability of genres and
the endurance of modernist styles past their historical period. According
to Self, Altmans films of the 1980s and 1990s cease his interrogation of
genre but remain committed to the modernist impulses of irony,
experimentation, reflexivity, and social critique (Self 2002, 103).
