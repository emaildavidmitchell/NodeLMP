Robert (Wilfred Levick) Simpson (1921-97)
Edward Venn


English composer, writer and broadcaster. Of the belief that modern music
had lost the rhythmic vitality and movement of the Viennese Classics
(principally Haydn and Beethoven), Simpson's compositions - dominated by
eleven symphonies and sixteen string quartets - sought to recapture
something of this energy for the twentieth century.

Following his parents' wishes, Simpson originally began training as a
doctor, giving up in 1942 in order to study music privately with Herbert
Howells for four years. In his earliest compositions, a SONATA FOR PIANO
(1946) and a set of Variations and Finale on a Theme of Haydn (1948),
Simpson's interest in large-scale, logical construction, palindromes, and
rhythmic momentum were already apparent. Simpson's first acknowledged
SYMPHONY was submitted for a DMus at the University of Durham (1951), a
single-movement work that, in its exploration of different types of
movement and character within a basic pulse, established principles that
Simpson was to explore throughout his career.

Simpson's conception of musical energy relied on the tensions generated by
a sense of tonality. Though his practice in this area was modelled on prior
examples  the STRING QUARTETS 4-6 (1973-75) were in essence studies of
Beethoven's 'Rasumovsky' quartets, and the numerous Variations on themes by
other composers fall into this category - Simpson's tonal language is
distinctive and decidedly twentieth-century in character.

In his later music Simpson preferred to emphasise the generative roles
played by intervals, as in the SYMPHONY No. 7 (1977) and STRING QUARTET No.
8 (1979). Allied with an increasing focus on symmetry, whether in chord
constructions or in palindromes (the Ninth String Quartet (Variations and
Fugue on a Theme of Haydn) (1982) consists of 32 palindromic variations on
a theme that is itself a palindrome), Simpson's music was thus even more
concentrated, logical and focused. The SYMPHONY No. 9 (1986), a 50-minute
single movement, reaches an extreme in presenting an unaltered basic pulse
throughout, over which Simpson projects a wide variety of motion.

His adherence to tonality and his ongoing interest in momentum and
symphonic thought, manifested in a severe and unmistakably twentieth-
century language, led him to describe himself as a 'conservationist' rather
than a 'conservative'; he has also been described  with less
justification, perhaps - as an avant-garde radical.

As an animateur, writer and broadcaster, Simpson did much to challenge
received opinion. The Exploratory Concerts Society, founded by Simpson in
1947, focused on forgotten works and composers; his 'The Innocent Ear'
radio series for the BBC (which Simpson joined in 1951) discussed and
played works but withheld the composer's name until the end. His writings
on Bruckner and Nielsen popularised the music of these composers in the
English-speaking world; work on Bach, the Viennese Classics, Sibelius, and
the symphony was also significant.
