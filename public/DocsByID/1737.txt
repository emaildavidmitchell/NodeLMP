Schroeter, Werner (19452010)

Andreas Ehrenreich (University of Vienna)

German director and writer Werner Schroeter taught himself to use a camera
in the late 1960s. He presented his first shorts (in Super 8 and 16 mm) at
the festival of Knokke-le-Zoute. After the critical success of his
breakthrough Eika Katappa (1969), Schroeter went on to create over twenty
experimental feature-length fiction films and documentaries, each infused
with his unique style and sensibility. Schroeter always displayed a
profound interest in music, from opera to pop songs, mixing his favourite
artists Maria Callas and Caterina Valente into the soundtracks that are an
essential part of his work. He blended high and low art to heighten
emotionhis main aesthetic concern. His films convey the extreme emotional
states of his characters without regard for narrative coherence or
psychological development. The films' stylistically excessive, operatic
scenarios are presented through a loose series of meticulously composed
tableaux. His films are highly artifical and manneristic. They are studded
with literary and artistic references and, because of this citational
quality, often slip into pastiche. Death and decay and the instability of
sexual identity are cental preoccupations throughout his oeuvre.
