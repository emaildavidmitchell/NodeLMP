Scholder, Fritz (American; Luiseño 1937-2005)



Fritz Scholder was one of the most iconic contemporary Native American artists of the late twentieth century. Scholder was raised primarily in the Dakotas, where his father worked as a Bureau of Indian Affairs school administrator.  After studying art under Oscar Howe (Yanktonai Sioux 1915-1983), and then Wayne Thiebaud  (1920--), Scholder earned his Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Arizona in 1964. As an instructor at the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico from 1964 to 1969, Scholder tapped into the radical politics and Pop art sensibilities of the era and produced a series of paintings now known as the “Indians” or “Monster Indians.”  These parodic portraits, which combined anguished, distorted features with cartoonish renderings in candy colours, were an effective subversion of the romanticised images of Indians then popular in Santa Fe. Along with his former student T.C. Canon (Kiowa 1946-1978), Scholder had a two-man show at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and was the subject of a 2008 retrospective exhibition held at the newly formed National Museum of the American Indian.
