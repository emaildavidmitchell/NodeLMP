Rebay (von Ehrenwiesen), Bnss. Hilla (1890-1967) 		Words: 199



Before emigrating to the United States, Hilla Rebay, a painter, was part of an artistic circle in Germany that included Jean Arp, Rudolf Bauer, and others. In 1927, she began advising Solomon R. Guggenheim in building his extraordinary collection of non-objective art. Rebay served as director and curator of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting between 1939 and 1952. This museum subsequently was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Among her achievements was selecting Frank Lloyd Wright to design a “temple” in which to house the collection, now one of the most iconic buildings in the world. She bequeathed a portion of her art collection, which included works by Piet Mondrian and other European modernists, to the museum upon her death.
