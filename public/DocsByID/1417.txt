Luigi Nono (1924-1990)

Carola Nielinger-Vakil

Luigi Nono stands out as one of the most uncompromising modernist  composers
of the Italian avant-garde. Together with Karlheinz Stockhausen  and  Pierre
Boulez, Nono was one of the leading representatives  of  integral  serialism
in Europe after  1945.  Nono  is  further  known  for  his  political  music
theatre,  his  innovative  spatial  use  of  electronic  music   and   live-
electronics,  avant-garde  and  microtonal  instrumental  writing   and   an
exceptionally lyric and communicative application of  complex  compositional
procedures.



      Luigi Nono  was  born  into  a  wealthy  Venetian  family  just  after
Mussolini came to power. Towards the  end  of  WWII,  Nono  began  to  study
composition with G Fr Malipiero at the Venice conservatoire (1943-45)  while
completing  a  law  degree  at   Padova   University   (1942-47).   At   the
conservatoire, Bruno Madernas influential composition tutorials  sparked  a
life-long interest in Renaissance polyphony and  the  works  of  the  Second
Viennese School. Equally  fundamental  was  Hermann  Scherchens  conducting
course (Venice, 1948). Luigi  Dallapiccolas  lyric  serialism  was  another
formative influence at this time. Nonos first major  work,  the  Variazioni
canoniche sulla serie dellop.41 di Arnold Schnberg,  was  premiered  under
Scherchen at  the  Darmstadt  New  Music  Courses  in  1950.  Together  with
Karlheinz Stockhausen  and  Pierre  Boulez,  Nono  subsequently  established
himself as one of the leading composers  of  integral  serialism.  Scherchen
remained an important mentor,  introducing  Nono  to  Paul  Dessau  and  the
theatre of Bertolt Brecht in East Berlin, and  to  Karl  Amadeus  Hartmanns
Musica Viva in Munich. Through Scherchen, Nono  was  also  involved  in  the
preparation of several of Schoenbergs scores, most notably for the  Hamburg
premiere of Moses und Aron (1954)  where  he  met  his  future  wife,  Nuria
Schoenberg.

      Nonos search for new means of expression in music  was  coupled  with
political ideals from  the  outset.  Like  many  Italian  intellectuals  who
experienced the Resistenza, Nono joined the Italian Communist  Party  (1952)
and remained a life-long party-member. Anti-fascist concerns determine  much
of Nonos early work and manifest themselves in the choice of  material  and
text (the series of Schoenbergs Ode to Napoleon; songs of  the  Resistenza;
testimonies of European  resistance  fighters,  poetry  by  Federico  Garca
Lorca and Paul luard). A masterpiece of the  fifties  is  the  anti-fascist
cantata  Il  canto  sospeso  (1956).  Final  words  of  European  resistance
fighters are here set with the strictest of serial procedures  and  a  vocal
and instrumental lyricism that is entirely appropriate to the stark  content
of these texts (music ex.). Other major works of this period set  poetry  by
Cesare Pavese and Guiseppe Ungaretti.

      With a penchant for vocal writing and a strong interest  in  political
theatre (Piscator, Brecht, Sartre, Mayakovsky and the Russian  avant-garde),
Nono was intuitively drawn to music theatre, the traditional  boundaries  of
which he continuously sought to transcend. An early ballet,  The  Red  Cloak
(Berlin, 1954), already makes unconventional use of two vocal  soloists  and
chorus. Politically engaged music theatre is realised with the  two  scenic
actions, Intolleranza 1960 (1960-61) and Al gran sole carico damore (1972-
74). These montage works make use of a variety of literary  and  documentary
texts to confront and engage the spectator with current  political  concerns
in the light of historical precedents. In both works the  solo  vocal  lines
often branch out into the choral collective and dramatically  contrast  with
dense  orchestral  textures.  The  first  production  of  Intolleranza  1960
(Venice, 1961) was devised in  collaboration  with  Josef  Svoboda  (Laterna
Magica, Prague) and the Venetian painter Emilio Vedova and much of  Al  gran
sole was conceived  together  with  the  director  of  the  Taganka  Theatre
Moscow, Yuri Ljubimov. On a smaller scale, A floresta   jovem  e  cheja  de
vida (1966), a collaboration with The Living Theatre, is  perhaps  the  most
radical realisation of Nonos concept of engaged scenic action.

      After two controversial lectures in which Nono warned of  un-reflected
use of chance procedures (History and  Present  in  the  Music  of  Today,
1959) and defended his  layered  and  often  highly  abstract  use  of  text
(Music  Text  Song,  1960),  Nono  left  Darmstadt  behind  (1961).  His
overtly political works of the  sixties  and  seventies  involved  prolonged
periods of work at the RAI Studio di fonologia, Milan. Combining  electronic
materials and live performance, Nono  primarily  focussed  on  creating  new
performance and listening conditions,  including  working  class  audiences.
Spatial  use  of  electronics  was  first  envisaged  (but  not  immediately
realised) for Nonos Composizione per  orchestra  n.2:  Diario  polacco  58
(1959, rev. with tape 1965). For Intolleranza 1960, the chorus was  recorded
and transmitted through loudspeakers to liberate  the  musical  action  from
the visual events on stage. Factory noises on  four  channel  tape  contrast
with a lyric solo  soprano  part  in  La  fabbrica  illuminata  (1964).  The
electronic music for Peter Weisss The Investigation (1965) was  transmitted
in complete darkness from above, below and  all  sides  of  the  auditorium.
During this period of intense political activism, Nonos choice  of  subject
matter was further influenced by several journeys to  Latin  America.  As  a
composer,  however,  Nono  often  found   himself   isolated:   deemed   too
formalist in the East and too socialist in the West.

      Many of Nonos technically  most  advanced  works  were  conceived  in
collaboration    with    distinguished    performers:     Rudolf     Kolisch
(Varianti,1957), Carla Henius (La  fabbrica  illuminata),  Maurizio  Pollini
(Como una ola di fuerza e luz, 1971; .....sofferte onde serene.....,  1975),
the LaSalle Quartet (Fragmente-Stille, an Diotima, 1980), Gidon  Kremer  (La
lontananza nostalgica utopica future, 1989). Throughout the  eighties,  Nono
consistently explored the use  of  live-electronics  in  collaboration  with
Roberto Fabbriciani (fl), Ciro Scarponi (cl), Giancarlo Schiaffini (tb)  and
the newly founded Solistenchor at the Experimental Studio  of  the  Heinrich
Strobel Foundation Freiburg. The masterpiece of this period is the  tragedy
of listening Prometeo (1975-85) with a libretto by the philosopher  Massimo
Cacciari.  This  fractured  and  highly  philosophical  reflection  on   the
Prometheus myth reaches new heights of  musical  expression  by  taking  the
listener to the limits of audibility. Four  orchestras  and  six  groups  of
vocal and instrumental soloists are distributed around the audience and  the
drama unfolds entirely in sound  and  space.  Microtonal  processes,  avant-
garde techniques and dense instrumental textures are interwoven  with  vocal
music of transparent purity. The focus on minute change as  well  as  large-
scale musical processes is enhanced by means of the  live-electronics  which
transform and move the sound in real time. (Music clip) Cacciaris  Prometeo
continued to inspire Nono up to his death in 1990, exploring  the  infinite
possibilities of this new  sound  world  in  a  series  of  works  entitled
Caminantes (after Machado and Nietzsches Wanderer).

Nonos music is published by Schott and  Ricordi.  The  Fondazione  Archivio
Luigi Nono in Venice (pres.  Nuria  Schoenberg-Nono,  dir.  Claudia  Vincis)
