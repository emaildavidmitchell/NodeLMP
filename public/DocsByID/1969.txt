TRUFFAUT, Franois (b.6 February 1932, Paris, France; d.  21 October 1984,
Neuilly-sur-Seine, France)
Franois Truffaut was a French film director, actor and film critic, best
known for being one of the founders of the French New Wave - a movement he
helped usher in with his film Les Quatre Cents Coups  (The 400 Blows, 1959)
- a realistic, compassionate tale of youthful alienation and rebellion.
Truffauts troubled childhood and teenage years were  marked  by  an  uneasy
family life, truancy and petty crime, but  also  by  voracious  reading  and
film going. Like many of the French New Wave members,  he  frequented  Henri
Langlois influential Cinemathque Franaise.  He  would  later  reflect  on
this  period  in  The  400  Hundred  Blows,  whose  defiant  yet  vulnerable
protagonist, Antoine Doinel, is an alter ego of sorts.
In 1948 Truffaut met the film critic Andr Bazin who would act as both
mentor and personal support. Bazin got him work at Cahiers du Cinma (which
he had recently founded). Truffauts tenure at the magazine is marked by
critical intransigence and an astute spirit of observation; his 1954
article A Certain Tendency in French Cinema attacks the staid academism
of the French filmmaking of the 1950s. His acerbic output would earn him a
ban from the Cannes Film Festival in 1958. However, one year later,
Truffaut would return to collect the Best Director award for The 400 Blows.
Like Bazin, Truffaut was strongly influenced by auteurism, in particular by
Alexandre Astrucs concept of the camera-pen (camra-stylo) as the
primary expressive tool of any director. Compared to other New Wave
directors like Jean-Luc Goddard, Alain Resnais or Chris Marker, Truffauts
style is less formally radical,, but his commitment to the primarily visual
aspect of cinema was just as strong. His most experimental film is probably
Tirez sur le pianist [Shoot the Piano Player]  (1960)- a gangster story
featuring jagged editing and confusing voiceovers. His interest lay mainly
in genre exploration, and like many French filmmakers of the period, he had
a great admiration for Hitchcock, about whom he wrote an influential volume
in 1967. Over his 25 years long career, he directed thrillers such as La
Marie tait en noir (The Bride Wore Black, 1968) and science fiction films
like Fahrenheit 451 (1966), an adaptation of Ray Bradburys novel.  In
Jules et Jim (Jules and Jim, 1962), another New Wave landmark, he explored
the amorous idealism and eventual tragic dissolution of a romantic
triangle; with La Peau douce (The Soft Skin, 1964), he created a domestic
drama,  and a story of marital infidelity. Truffaut also continued Antoine
Doinels adventures over four more films: the  short Antoine et Colette
(1962), Baisers voles (Stolen Kisses, 1968), Domicile conjugal (Bed and
Board, 1970), and L'Amour en fuite (Love on the Run, 1979).
Two of his later films, L'Enfant sauvage (The Wild Child, 1970) and La Nuit
amricaine (Day for Night, 1972), merit special mention. The Wild Child
(based on true historical incidents) is the story of Jean Itard (played by
Truffaut himself), an 18th-century physician who attempts to recivilize a
seemingly wild boy found in the neighboring woods. The delicate,
sympathetic drama uses some relatively anachronistic techniques like iris
shots as an audience distancing mechanism and explores the fluid boundary
between nature and culture, civilization and wilderness. Day for Night is a
heavily metatextual film, exploring, like Fellinis 8 1/2 the personal toll
of filmmaking.
Truffaut is also notable for  playing  one  of  the  main  roles  in  Steven
Spielbergs Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).
