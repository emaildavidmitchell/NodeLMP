Makavejev, Dušan (b. October 13, 1932 Belgrade, Yugoslavia -- ) 

Dušan Makavejev is an avant-garde Marxist Serbian filmmaker whose film techniques, exuberant black humor, and themes mixing sexual and political transgressions made him one of the most radical directors in the European New Wave of the 1960s and 1970s. He was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Belgrade, Serbia).  A member of the first generation of anti-Stalinist communists, he studied psychology at Belgrade University, where he also began making short films. Despite the suppression of some of his documentary shorts and a 1962 stage-play, he was permitted to advance into feature production. Along with his earlier writings and shorts, his first feature, Čovek nije tica [Man Is Not a Bird] (1965), established him as a leader in the novi film [new film] movement which championed artistic freedom and experimentation within a Marxist context. Makavejev’s films were characterized by violent outcomes of sexual repression, outrageous humour, variety/carnival acts, satires of both western capitalism and Soviet authoritarianism, surreal images, a philosophy that linked sexuality with politics, and a multi-layered mixture of styles and forms which included documentary, found footage, clips from older features etc. Though his filmmaking career continued into the mid-1990s, his reputation rests primarily on his first five features:  Man Is Not a Bird, Ljubavni slučaj ili Tragedija službenice PTT [Love Affair, or The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator] (1967), Nevinost bez zaštite [Innocence Unprotected] (1968), WR: Misterije organizma  [WR: Mysteries of the Organism] (1971), and Sweet Movie (1974).  Government reaction to WR forced him to make his subsequent films outside Yugoslavia until the fall of the Iron Curtain.
