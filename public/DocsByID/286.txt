Charles Tory Bruce was born in Port Shoreham, Nova Scotia on May 11, 1906; he died in Toronto, Ontario on December 19, 1971. 



Upon graduating from Mount Allison University in 1927, the year his first book of poetry Wild Apples appeared, Bruce began his life-long profession as a journalist, first with the Halifax Morning-Chronicle, and then with the Canadian Press’s New York Bureau (1928-1933). In Halifax, Bruce began his affiliation with the Song Fisherman Circle, a relationship that shaped his second book of poems, Tomorrow’s Tide (1932). In 1933, Bruce transferred to Toronto, where he published four more books of poetry: Personal Note (1941), Grey Ship Moving (1945), The Flowering Summer (1947), and The Mulgrave Road (1951), which won the Governor General’s Literary Award (1951). 



Though Bruce’s regional poetics are not generally regarded as avant-garde, A. J. M. Smith included him in the seminal Book of Canadian Poetry (1943) on the basis that his work “represent[s] a certain ‘aspect’ of the modern movement” in its “simplification of technique” (28-9).

In 1954 Bruce wrote his first and only novel, The Channel Shore, a story of three families in a small Nova Scotia community that exemplifies the regional realism of Bruce’s oeuvre—it includes the story of a demobilized soldier returning home from the front. His collection of short stories, The Township of Time: A Chronicle (1959) builds upon this epic motif and spans 150-years and six generations of maritime characters. Bruce ended his writing career with News and the Southams (1968), a biography of the influential newspaper family. Andrew Wainwright notes, “virtually all of Charles Bruce’s creative prose and a good proportion of his poetry…draw upon his experience and knowledge of life along the north shore of Chedabucto Bay [Nova Scotia, Canada]” (ii). Bruce continues to be anthologized and studied as a regional writer.
