KAUL, Mani (December 25, 1944-July 6, 2011) 

Mani Kaul was an Indian film director chiefly known for his contribution to the Indian New Wave or Parallel Cinema, and his role in the development of experimental cinema in South Asia. In 1969, after graduating from the Film and Television Institute of India, where he had studied for a short but significant period of time under one of India’s most revered film directors, Ritwik Ghatak, Kaul made his feature-length directorial debut with Uski roti (Our Daily Bread). The film is considered a landmark in the history of Indian art cinema mainly because it showcased a radical shift of attention from narrative or affect, to cinematic form. Two of his next feature films, Ashadh ka ek din (One Day in Ashadh, 1971) and Duvidha (1973), continued Kaul’s experimentations with cinematic style and were praised lavishly by critics. After these three films were made, Kaul began experimenting with other cinematic idioms, making documentaries (some on various local musical and theatrical traditions), short films, and even a television mini-series. In addition, he was a teacher of both music and film. He served as a visiting lecturer in Europe and the USA and published several theoretical accounts of filmmaking.
