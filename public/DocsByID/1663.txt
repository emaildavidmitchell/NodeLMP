Roszak, Theodore (1907-1981)
Theodore Roszak was a visual artist of the machine age. Born in Poland but
raised in Chicago, Roszak trained at the School of the Art Institute of
Chicago and began his career in drawing, printmaking, and painting. In the
1930s his artistic practice grew to encompass photography and sculpture,
and he is primarily remembered for his pioneering work with sheet metal and
welded steel. In his art, Roszak employed forms that are variously
architectural, biomorphic, anthropomorphic, and technological. He was
influenced by Cubism, Constructivism, and Surrealism and made futuristic
abstract sculptures like Bi-Polar in Red (1938) and tortured animalistic
objects like Spectre of Kitty Hawk (1946-47), which reflect his changing
perspectives on the virtues and perils of technology. During World War II
he taught aircraft mechanics and built airplanes for the Brewster Aircraft
Corporation. He taught at Sarah Lawrence College in the 1940s and 1950s and
died in New York City in 1981.
