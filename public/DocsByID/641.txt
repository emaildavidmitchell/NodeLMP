The Flower Thief (1960)

Josh Guilford (Brown University)

The Flower Thief is a feature-length experimental film produced by the
American artist Ron Rice in the North Beach section of San Francisco amidst
the dwindling of that regions once-vibrant Beat culture.  The film follows
its titular protagonist  portrayed by Taylor Mead  as he meanders about
the city. The Flower Thief depicts his encounters with various beatniks and
authority figures in a loose, episodic structure, and touching on prevalent
themes of the budding 60s counterculture such as social disengagement,
drugs, spontaneity, and queerness.  Valuing improvisation over scripted
narrative and flaunting various technical imperfections, The Flower Thief
was heralded upon its New York release as a major work of the New American
Cinema movement, and has subsequently been referred to as the purest
expression of the Beat sensibility in cinema.1  It was produced on a
shoestring budget and was shot with outdated black and white 16mm film
stock that gives the image a washed-out luminosity. The soundtrack  a
haphazard sonic collage that Rice assembled with a quarter-inch tape
recorder  shifts disjunctively between musical sequences, poetic
interludes, and excerpts from movie soundtracks and lectures on mental
illness.  In addition to securing Rices position within the 60s avant-
garde, The Flower Thief also launched Meads career as an underground film
star.
