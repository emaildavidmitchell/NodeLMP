Eduardo Bértola was born in Coronel Moldes, Córdoba, Argentina, 14 July 1939, and died in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, on 20 February 1996. Bértola was part of a generation of Latin American musicians from the 1960s and 1970s that included Joaquín Orellana from Guatemala, Coriún Aharonián from Uruguay, as well as Graciela Paraskevaídis, Alcides Lanza, Gerardo Gandini, Mariano Etkin and Oscar Bazán from Argentina. Bértola is recognised in the field of electroacoustic composition and, as Aharonián and Paraskevaídis have pointed out, his work is characterized by timbral exploration, distinctive textures, use of silence and repetition, austerity of materials, and a structure based on repetitive units without development.

Eduardo Bértola was born in Córdoba, Argentina, 14 July 1939, and died in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, on 20 February 1996. Bértola was part of a generation of Latin American musicians from the 1960s and 1970s that included Joaquín Orellana from Guatemala, Coriún Aharonián from Uruguay, as well as Graciela Paraskevaídis, Alcides Lanza, Gerardo Gandini, Mariano Etkin and Oscar Bazán from Argentina. Bértola is recognised in the field of electroacoustic composition and, as Aharonián and Paraskevaídis have pointed out, his work is characterized by timbral exploration, distinctive textures, use of silence and repetition, austerity of materials, and a structure based on repetitive units without development.



Between 1963 and 1968, Bértola lived in the province of Chaco, Argentina, and collaborated with several institutional projects. Paraskevaídis (2001) notes that, while his earlier works date from the fifties, his mature production begins in 1966 with Variantes Alpha-Omega, composed for the Coro Polifónico de Chaco (Chaco Polyphonic Choir); Las doradas manzanas del sol, for piano, dedicated to Gerardo Gandini; Usher-II-2005, for piano duet, dedicated to Alcides lanza; and Procne, with an English text by Peter Quennell, for three sopranos and an instrumental group. 



Between 1968 and 1971, Bértola lived in Paris and met with Pierre Schaeffer, Iannis Xenakis, and Émile Leipp; he also participated in the International Summer Courses of New Music in Darmstadt, Germany. During this period, he composed two chamber pieces (Hertz and Signals) but, above all, devoted himself to experimenting with electroacoustic music in works like Episode (1969), Rouges (1969), Dynamus (1970), Penetraciones (1970, definitive version of Rouges from 1972), Penetraciones II (1971), and Pexoa (1971); later on he continued his production in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with Elictros (1971-1972), Gomecito contra la Siemens or el diablo de San Agustín (1973), Tramos (1975), Historias para un movimiento imaginario (1977), and Trovas, crónicas y epigramas I-VII (1977), his last electroacoustic piece.

Between 1973 and 1974, Bértola was a scholar at the Centro de Investigación en Comunicación Masiva, Arte y Tecnología (CICMAT, Centre for Research in Mass Communication, Art and Technology) in Argentina, where he studied with Francisco Kröpfl and composed several electroacoustic pieces, most of which are now missing. Gomecito contra la Siemens or el diablo de San Agustín, which recounts the story of a newspaper seller from Chaco, Argentina, is a reflection on good and evil which, according to Kröpfl, articulates such binary oppositions as regularity/irregularity and orientation/non-orientation. In Tramos, Bértola presents mostly radiophonic material in fragments, containing linear juxtapositions with reiterations, to form a collage. Paraskevaídis (1992) sees the work as a political sound document of Argentina in the years 1972–1974.

From 1971 until 1984, Bértola served on the teaching staff at the Cursos Latinoamericanos de Música Contemporánea (CLAMC, Latin American Contemporary Music Courses) and, in 1975 and 1976, worked at the Winter Festivals in Ouro Preto, Brazil, giving seminars on acoustics and electroacoustic music, where he developed his concept of ‘poor musics,’ a concept that aligns him to other Latin American composers like Oscar Bazán and Joaquín Orellana.



In Trópicos (1975), a trio for violin, flute and clarinet, dedicated to Orellana, Bértola returned to instrumental music composition, focusing on timbre, the psychoacoustic phenomena (differentials), and exploiting integrating acoustic distortions produced by extensions of the technical possibilities of instruments. Similarly, two versions of La visión de los vencidos (1978) were made under the same premises; the name (Vision of the Defeated) was taken from indigenous accounts of the Conquest of Mexico compiled by Miguel León-Portilla. Two duets were added in this period: Anjos xifópagos (1976), for two flutes, and Um no outro (1977), for two cellos, as well as two soloist works: for piano, and Traslaciones (1976), for flute, and the same work but for piano renamed as Tráfego (1976).

In 1979, Bértola moved to Brazil, living first in Brasilia and then in Belo Horizonte, serving as Professor of Electroacoustic and 20th Century Music. In this last period, he composed instrumental works only: chamber music for various instruments (A hora e a vez - Septeto Matraga –– a name taken from a story by João Guimarães Rosa –– from 1989, for seven instruments; Rituais do imaginário from 1992, for twenty instruments; and Cantos a Ho from 1993, dedicated to Ho Chi-Minh, for seven instruments), and four duets (Duo dos temperamentos e das cores from 1984, for violin and viola; De sonhos e quedas from 1990, for two pianos; Retornos do tempo from 1991, for two bassoons; and Caminhos de sinais from 1992, for two clarinets). In addition to these works, he created soloist pieces, like the second version for piano of Las doradas manzanas del sol (1984) and Lucípherez (1994) for double bass. He also composed orchestral pieces in the 1980s, starting with Os Sonhos (1982), followed by two versions of Grandes trópicos, the first from 1992, the second and last of his works from 1995, the year before he took his own life. The latter cited quotes from previous works, such as Dynamus, Trópicos and La visión de los vencidos, and to Bértola it meant a synthesis ‘of all my attempts and efforts on the side of the Latin American movement to search for a new, free music’ (Paraskevaídis 2001: 42).
