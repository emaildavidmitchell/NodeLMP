Lloyd Rees is known for his landscapes celebrating the area around Sydney and the south coast and for his masterly drawings. He was born in Brisbane on 17 March 1895 and studied Art at Brisbane’s Central Technical College. He moved to Sydney in 1917 and then worked as a commercial artist for Smith & Julius Studios. For 40 years, between 1946 and 1986, Rees taught Art at Sydney University’s Faculty of Architecture, which gave him the freedom to paint without being concerned about sales. He made many trips to Europe, and was particularly inspired by the French and Italian countryside.

He was born in Brisbane on 17 March 1895 and studied Art at Brisbane’s Central Technical College. He moved to Sydney in 1917 and then worked as a commercial artist for Smith & Julius Studios. For 40 years, between 1946 and 1986, Rees taught Art at Sydney University’s Faculty of Architecture, which gave him the freedom to paint without being concerned about sales. He made many trips to Europe, and was particularly inspired by the French and Italian countryside. He moved to Hobart in 1986. Most of Rees’s work is concerned with depicting the effects of light. In later years it became increasingly experimental, semi-abstract impressions with lighter tones, showing the influence of Turner. In the 1980s he began to suffer from poor eyesight, which led him to create semi-abstract impressions from memory improvisations. He died in Hobart on 2 December 1988. His work is held by all major Australian galleries. He has been the subject of several surveys, including retrospectives organised by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, in 1969, 1995 and 2013 and an exhibition at Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane, in 2011.
