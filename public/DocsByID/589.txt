	Mariano Etkin is an Argentinean composer, which is among the most important Latin-American composers of the second half of the twentieth century. He received his main musical education in his hometown, Buenos Aires, and continued his studies in the United States and Europe. Both, his musical creation as his theoretical production are a benchmark for composers and researchers. By exploring perception thresholds, Etkin’s works unfold between real and apparent in a profuse and ambiguous sound world. His writings address the study of musical works and issues around music creation.

Musical studies and career

	Etkin started his training from a rich family musical environment and at the Williams Conservatory of Buenos Aires. The reading of Juan Carlos Paz’s Introduction to the music of our time (Introducción a la música de nuestro tiempo, 1955) prompted him to look for other ways and began studying piano and music theory with Ernesto Epstein. Subsequently continued his composition studies under the guidance of Guillermo Graetzer. Etkin joined the group of composers around the Agrupación Euphonia (then Agrupación Música Viva), formed mainly by Gerardo Gandini, Antonio Tauriello, Armando Krieger and Alcides Lanza. Together with this group of young composers, Etkin explored through the creation of international trends in vogue during the '50s. His first public premiere was Three Pieces for Piano (1959). Between 1965 and 1966, Etkin participated as a fellow in the Latin American Centre for Advanced Musical Studies (CLAEM) of the Instituto Torcuato Di Tella (Buenos Aires). There, he studied with Alberto Ginastera Etkin, Gerardo Gandini, Maurice Le Roux, Iannis Xenakis, Earle Brown and Mario Davidovsky, among others. Between 1968 and 1970, he won the Dutch government grants and the Organization of American States (OAS) to study, respectively, Conducting at the Utrecht Conservatory with Paul Hupperts and composition at the Juilliard School of Music in New York with Luciano Berio. In the Music Academy of Basel, Switzerland, he completed a course of direction and interpretation of twentieth century music with Pierre Boulez. In 1971, the CLAEM awarded him a second scholarship for composition.

	Etkin has spread his musical thinking through various articles, lectures and their extensive teaching. The writings, published mostly in Dérives (Montréal), Revista del Instituto Superior de Música (Santa Fe), Música e Investigación (Buenos Aires), Revista Arte e Investigación (La Plata) and other compilations, addresses some of the problems on the composition of most interest to Etkin: perceptual thresholds on the length and height of sound, identity issues, treatment of musical form and sound material.

	Etkin was a professor at the National University of Tucuman, Rio Cuarto and Litoral (Argentina), at McGill University and Wilfrid Laurier University (Canada). Currently, he teaches at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the National University of La Plata.

Production and characteristics of the works

	Most of the work of Etkin is instrumental. Although not usually resort to the use of the human voice, his works are often linked to texts or extra-musical elements. Thus, the composer gives multiple meanings to their works. While Etkin's music is not discursive, because from the formal point of view there are not thematic exhibitions or developments of motives, it is full of poetic-dramatic elements. Some titles of works suggest places, moments or situations of life and, in turn, it refers to the type of procedure or material Etkin explores each one of them. Precisely, Etkin based their works on a selection and processing of sound material rather than the type of relationship between the sounds. Thus, he produces what he calls a "Material music". To a large degree, Etkin's works have micro-variation process of sound material. These small changes may be related to the duration or the spectrum of harmonics of sounds. His works received awards in Argentina: Fondo Nacional de las Artes and Municipalidad de Buenos Aires, in the Netherlands: Gaudeamus Foundation and Switzerland: Sixth International Composers Seminar Boswil.
