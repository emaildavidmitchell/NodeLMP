Federico Fellini

Michela Russo (Texas A & M University)

Federico Fellini (Rimini, January 20, 1920  Rome, October 31, 1993) was  an
Italian  film  director  and  scriptwriter.  Considered  one  of  the   most
influential filmmakers of  the  20th  century,  Fellini  is  known  for  his
visionary, picaresque and baroque style, full of veiled  satire  and  subtle
melancholy. He contributed to the scripts of films  by  Roberto  Rossellini,
such as Rome Open City (1945) and Pais (1946). Winner of  four  Oscars  for
Best  Foreign  Film,  in  1993  he  was  awarded  the  Oscar  for   Lifetime
Achievement. He  was  two-time  winner  of  the  Moscow  International  Film
Festival (1963 and 1987) and also received the  Palme  d'Or  at  the  Cannes
Film Festival in 1960, and in 1985 the Golden Lion for Lifetime  Achievement
at the Venice Film Festival.

Fellini began  his  career  in  the  late  1930s,  collaborating  with  cine
journals and magazines and writing sketches and short plays for  the  radio.
In the 1940s,  having  met  the  Italian  director  and  scriptwriter  Piero
Tellini, he began to work on numerous screenplays. In 1943, he  married  the
actress Giulietta Masina (1921-1994), who  would  perform  in  many  of  his
films, such as La Strada (1954), Le notti di Cabiria  (1957)  and  Ginger  e
Fred [Ginger and Fred, 1986].

Fellinis first full-length movie,  Luci  del  Variet  (1950),  co-directed
with Alberto Lattuada, describes the world of variety shows with  irony  and
a sense of the grotesque. It was  a  commercial  failure.  Two  years  later
Fellini realized his first movie  alone,  Lo  Sceicco  Bianco  (1952),  with
Alberto  Sordi  and  Giulietta  Masina.  The  film  already   contains   the
autobiographical and fantastic elements characteristic  of  his  work  as  a
whole.  I  vitelloni  (1953),  about  the  daily  life  of  five  provincial
slackers, was received with  great  enthusiasm.  These  three  titles,  with
their accurate but tragicomic portraits  of  1950s  Italy,  still  retain  a
neorealist flavor in their attention to societal concerns of everyday  life.
With La strada (1954), a circus fable that  enjoyed  worldwide  success,  Il
bidone (1955), and Le notti di Cabiria  (1957),  Fellini  begins  to  depart
from neorealism. His films gradually become infused with a secular  form  of
Christian existentialism, revolving on the notions of grace and  conversion,
and his characters develop a visionary relation to the world. With La  dolce
vita (1960), starring Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg, 8  (1963)  and
Giulietta degli spiriti  (1965),  Fellini's  attention  moves  towards  more
subjective  themes.  His  growing  interest   in   psychoanalysisespecially
Jungianand dreams is particularly visible in two filmic episodes  of  these
years: Le tentazioni del Dottor Antonio  in  Boccaccio  '70  (1962),  with
contributions by Luchino Visconti, Mario Monicelli, and  Vittorio  De  Sica,
among others, and Toby Dammit in Tre passi nel delirio (1968). In 1969  he
made Satyricon, an adaptation of Petronius  Latin  classic.  Satyricon,  La
dolce vita and Roma (1972) form a sort of trilogy providing  a  mythological
portrait of the Italian capital. Roma  is  also  part  of  another  trilogy,
along with Block-notes di un regista (1969) and I clowns  (1970),  revolving
around the nature of cinema.  Amarcord  (1973)  evokes  his  adolescence  in
Rimini and represents the last of Fellinis great  successes.  Subsequently,
he re-interpreted the figure of the famous Latin lover Giacomo Casanova  (Il
Casanova di Fellini, 1976), and staged a critique of contemporary  Italy  in
Prova d'orchestra [Orchestra Reharsal, 1979], La citt delle  donne  (1980),
E la nave va (1983), Ginger e Fred (1985), and La voce  della  luna  (1990).
However, this last phase  of  his  work  was  not  commercially  successful.
Intervista (1980), an account of his relationship  with  cinema,  represents
his last achievement; it follows up on his print autobiography Fare un  film
(1980). Fellini died of a stroke on the 31st of October 1993 in Rome.
