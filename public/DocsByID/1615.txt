The Brazilian architect and town planner Affonso Eduardo Reidy was born in Paris and studied architecture at the National School of Fine Arts of Rio de Janeiro (1926-1930). The school’s newly appointed director, Lucio Costa, sought progressive teachers to join the faculty in an attempt to reform the school in a modernist direction. At Costa’s invitation, Reidy became an assistant lecturer upon his graduation in 1931. Reidy was also a trainee and assistant (1929-1931) of Alfred Agache, the French town planner who was, at the time, responsible for the master plan of Rio de Janeiro. Reidy became an architect of the city council in 1932 (Rio was Brazil’s capital at that time), and then began his thirty-year career in architectural design and planning that helped define Brazilian modern architecture.



Alongside the architect Gerson Pompeu Pinheiro, Reidy was responsible for one of Rio’s first modernist buildings, the Albergue da Boa Vontade (1931-1932). He participated in designing the Ministry of Education and Health (1936), which became a key work of Brazilian modern architecture. To have worked on this project under the direction of Le Corbusier was a pivotal experience for the young architect.

Alongside the architect Gerson Pompeu Pinheiro, Reidy was responsible for one of Rio’s first modernist buildings, the Albergue da Boa Vontade (1931-1932). He participated in designing the Ministry of Education and Health (1936), which became a key work of Brazilian modern architecture. To have worked on this project under the direction of Le Corbusier was a pivotal experience for the young architect.



Reidy’s designs for Rio de Janeiro expressed his own modernist vision of town planning. This is noticeable in his most noted project, Pedregulho (Conjunto Residencial Prefeito Mendes de Moraes, 1946), and in the partially constructed Marquês de São Vicente (1952), which were both projects of the City’s Department of Popular Housing under the direction of the engineer, and his partner, Carmen Portinho. Pedregulho was a prizewinner at São Paulo’s Second Biennial (1953) and was highly praised by international critics. His projects were seen as combining the so-called social function of architecture with aspects of Brazilian modern architecture, such as the use of the curve, lightness, structural boldness, a seamless relationship between the building and the landscape, and an emphasis on the integration of the arts within architecture.

Reidy’s 1952 Experimental School in Asuncion, Paraguay, pioneered the local use of exposed concrete. This design was a precursor of his famous Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro (1953), which exemplified Reidy’s lifelong pursuit of integrating his buildings within the surrounding landscape.

In 1962, Reidy was asked to resume parts of his unrealised 1948 plan for the centre of Rio de Janeiro as part of the group responsible for the design and construction of Aterro Glória-Flamengo (Flamengo Park). In this final project in Reidy’s career, he was responsible for the park’s design and for the design of its bandstand, dance floor, playgrounds, and walkway.
