Born in Portland, Oregon in 1887, John Reed was a radical American journalist known for his depictions of Early-Twentieth Century labour politics and political revolutions. Reed's influential works include Insurgent Mexico (1914), an impressionistic account of the Mexican Revolution which draws upon Reed's experiences as a reporter embedded with revolutionary general Pancho Villa, and Ten Days That Shook the World (1919), a firsthand portrait of Russia's Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Both books, like Reed's shorter pieces published in The Masses and The Metropolitan, utilized objective reporting, first person perspective, and literary embellishment.

An aspiring poet early in his career, Reed was attracted to New York's bohemian Greenwich Village, where he became interested in left-wing politics and activist journalism. He married the journalist Louise Bryant in 1916 and worked on behalf of the Bolshevik government before his death in 1920.
