Hale A. Woodruff was an African American painter and educator associated
with the Negro Renaissance and later with the New York Abstract
Expressionists. Woodruff studied painting in France (1927-31) and taught
art at Atlanta University (1931- 45), where he initiated an influential
annual exhibition of African American art that promoted artists from around
the country. Woodruffs paintings depict the hardships of rural poverty for
African Americans in the South. His Amistad murals (1939) at Talledega
College are representative of his early expressive figurative style, which
portrays African Americans with a lyrical physicality in a narrative of
universal struggle and survival. In 1943 Woodruff was awarded the Rosenwald
Fellowship and, soon after, left Atlanta for New York to teach at New York
University (1945-68). There his style became more abstract as he
incorporated Dogon, Ashanti, and Yoruba imagery into his paintings.
Woodruff was a founding member of Spiral, a group that addressed the
persistent difficulties facing black artists in America. Woodruff remained
in New York until his death.
