Yimsiri,  Khien (1922-1971)
Khien Yimsiri was a pioneer of modern  Thai  sculpture  and  an  influential
teacher of sculpture at Silpakorn University. Born in Bangkok, he  graduated
from  Rongrian  Praneetsilapakam  (School  of  Fine  Arts,   now   Silpakorn
University) in 1941. In his early career, he won prestigious awards  at  the
National Exhibition of Art and received scholarships  to  study  abroad.  In
1949, Yimsiri studied under the guidance of Henry Moore at  Chelsea  College
of Art and Design in London. He was also  exposed  to  European  modern  art
during his scholarship at the Academy of Fine Arts  of  Rome  from  1953  to
1954. The revival of traditionalism in Thailand during 1940s and as well  as
Yimsiris work at the Fine Art Department provided him with  the  chance  to
explore Thai cultural heritage.  Buddha  Statues,  spiritual  dolls,  terra-
cotta toys and votive tablets of Sukhothai era  (1238-1438)  became  sources
of inspiration for him, in addition  to  Western  semi-abstract  sculptures.
His synthesis of indigenous and Western modernist  modes  of  representation
resulted in the fluid and simplified  human  forms  that  characterized  his
sculptures.  His  works  expressed  new  forms  in  modern  Thai  art  while
maintaining a traditional spirit,  leading  modern  Thai  sculpture  towards
abstraction. Particular themes in his work included the seated  figure,  the
mother and child and the family  group.  Yimsiri  received  an  honorary  as
Artist of Distinction in Sculpture in 1953.
