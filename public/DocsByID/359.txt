MARIATEGUI, José Carlos (June 14, 1894, Moquegua – April 16, 1930, Lima)



José Carlos Mariátegui was the most influential Latin American Marxist of the twentieth century. From 1914 to 1920 he worked as a journalist in Lima, Peru. Persecuted by the government, he traveled to Europe in 1920, where he studied Marxism in depth as a result of contact with socialist artists and intellectuals. In 1923 he returned to Peru persuaded of the importance of implementing socialism in the country. However, rather than following a European pattern, he developed a national variant of socialism that combined Marx’s ideas with the communal collectivism of indigenous culture. He saw in Andean collectivism a form of primitive communism useful for developing a Marxist revolution in a region with a small proletariat. His journal Amauta (1926-1930) was key for spreading his ideas as well as for opening a debate on socialism and culture in Peru and other countries. His most influential work, Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality (1928), is a materialist study of Peruvian society considered a fundamental text of Indigenismo.
