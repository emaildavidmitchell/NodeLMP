Lang, Andrew (1844-1912)

Andrew Lang was a Scottish born journalist, critic, translator, editor, poet, story writer, comic contributor to Punch. He was also a historian, anthropologist and collector of folk and fairy tales. His prolific works – his collected writing would fill nearly 300 library volumes (Green x) – were largely dismissed after his death. Lang epitomized the kind of Victorian-Edwardian man of letters modernists enjoyed pillorying.  Ezra Pound described Lang’s work on The Iliad as ‘the nadir of Homeric translation’ (249).  Nevertheless, like James Frazer (1854-1941), Lang brought his training in classical scholarship to bear on his study of myth, legend and folklore, part of the burgeoning field of anthropology in Victorian Britain. Lang saw in folklore the fictionalized transmission of cultural truths. From his perspective, his Fairy Books were not merely fanciful escapes for young readers, but important collections of culturally significant folklore narratives from nations around the world. In addition to his role as ethnographic collector of folklore Lang included his own tales in the Fairy books, thus participating in the great ‘flowering’ of the fairy tale in Victorian England (Zipes 157). Though Lang was annoyed to have his name so tied to fairy tales (Langstaff 137), he is chiefly remembered for these popular books.
