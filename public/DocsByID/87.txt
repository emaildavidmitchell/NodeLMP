Aiming to craft an ideal art periodical, Apollo continued the aesthetic program of its forerunners’, the World of Art and The Golden Fleece. According to its title and editorial manifesto, the creation of art works was seen as an act of worshipping Apollo, while the principle of Apollonianism alluded to Friedrich Nietzsche’s dichotomy of the Apollonian and the Dionysian.

Apollo was a consistent propagator of contemporary art trends and defined a new stage in the development of Russian Modernism. The periodical was international in scope; it devoted articles to Russian and European artists and art shows and featured sections dedicated to visual arts, literature, dance, theatre, and music.

The look of Apollo was created by Leon Bakst (1866-1924) and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky (1875-1957). Its design, less elaborate and extravagant than that of earlier journals, celebrated the best achievements of Russian art periodical culture and graphic design of the early twentieth century.
