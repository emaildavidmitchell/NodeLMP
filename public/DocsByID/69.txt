Canadian poet and editor Patrick Anderson was born on August 4, 1915 in Surrey, England. Though he was English by birth, and would later return to his homeland, he is often considered a Canadian poet, having produced most of his work there after immigrating in 1940. He came to Canada in 1942 to teach at a private school after attending Oxford and Columbia Universities. In this same year Anderson famously founded the Montreal literary magazine Preview with fellow poet F.R. Scott. Poets A.M. Klein and P.K. Page also ended up on the Preview’s editorial board. The work they published closely aligned with that of the English poets of the 1930s, for which they were famously criticized as having a colonial attitude, rather than attending to a native Canadian identity. John Sutherland’s First Statement, which led the attack, looked to nativist American models rather than Preview’s British paradigm. In 1945 Preview merged with this rival publication, bringing that localism into the fold, and becoming the much-respected Northern Review. The Northern Review published regularly until 1956, releasing several of Anderson’s books as well. During his Canadian years, he was also for a time a professor at McGill University.

Anderson’s work tended to be cosmopolitan, like that of the British modernists of the Bloomsbury group. Though he was married in 1940, he divorced 10 years later, traveling first to Malaysia to teach, then back to England where he began to embrace his homosexuality for the first time, entering into a relationship with a man named Alistair Sutherland. The two edited a homosocial anthology in the early 1960s, but he always treated his sexuality as a private matter, declining to be included in an anthology of gay male literature in 1972. His choice to stay in England, however, may have been influenced by his sexuality. John Sutherland had in 1943 printed a review of Anderson’s poetry which claimed it contained homoerotic themes and implying Anderson himself had homosexual experiences in the past. After Anderson threatened to sue him for libel, Sutherland printed a retraction.



During the 1990s interest in the incident between Anderson and Sutherland increased as it was considered important to the history of LGBT literature in Canada. It seems that Anderson did not feel at home in Canada as a gay man, however, choosing to remain in England from 1950 until his death. He did return intermittently as a guest lecturer to throughout the 1970s and his last volume of poetry, Return to Canada (1977), explored his relationship to his sometimes-homeland, sparking renewed interest in him as a Canadian poet more generally. Anderson died in Essex, England on March 17, 1979.
