Dweik, Taleb (1952--)



Taleb Dweik was born in 1952 in Jerusalem and studied art at the Hilwan University in Cairo. He was known for his paintings of the Palestinian landscape, in particular his picturesque and decorative images of the Holy City of Jerusalem executed in a painterly style that combines Impressionism and Expressionism. His work characteristically removed traces of the hardship of occupation on the city and explored the beauty of its landscape and historical sites. He has participated in group-exhibitions locally and internationally. He participated twice in the Sharjah Biennale, in the United Arab Emirates, in 1995 and 2003. He was the president of the Palestinian League of Artists between 1990-1996 and was the Dean of the faculty of fine arts at Al-Quds University between 2001-2003. He also held the position of inspector for fine arts education at Jerusalem’s schools. In that capacity he published a book on art education for secondary level students. From 2000 onwards he moved to exploring mixed media techniques and collage, investigating relationships between the land, heritage and childhood. He in particular adopts child-like style in his paintings to represent ideal images of the city filled with innocence and spontaneity, erasing traces of the harshness of occupation, and creating a city of bliss, beauty and utopia.



Dweik participated in group exhibitions in Syria (1989), Japan (1992 and 2000), Germany (1992), Spain (1993), the U.S.A. (1994), Canada (1996), Belgium (1996), the United Arab Emirates (1998), at the United Nations Headquarters in New York (1999), and in Tunisia and Morocco (2000). His work is held in many private collections. He collaborated with Dr. Sylvie Mansour on her book, Eye Witness to an Invasion. He was given the first prize at the Palestine Ecological Exhibition in Jerusalem in 1986 and at the “Jesus in the Palestinian Context” Exhibition at Dar Annadwa in Bethlehem in 2003. He also received honorary certificates from the Welfare Association, the League of Arab Doctors, the Jerusalem Committee, the Haya Cultural Centre and from the Sharjah Biennale.
