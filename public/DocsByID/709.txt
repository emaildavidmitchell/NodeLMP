Sankha Ghosh is a major figure in Bengali poetry since 1950s. Son of Manindra Kumar and Amalabala Ghosh, he was born at Chandar, now in Bangladesh, the ancestral home district being Barisal. Manindra Kumar was an eminent School Headmaster and an ardent Tagore lover. Sankha’s early education was in Chandraprabha Vidyapith at Paksi, Pabna. The ambience of this school was a strong influence in Sankha Ghosh’s early development.  He was later educated at Presidency College and Calcutta University and taught literature in several universities, finally retiring from Jadavpur University as Professor of Bengali.

The ambience of this school was a strong influence in Sankha Ghosh’s early development.  He was later educated at Presidency College and Calcutta University and taught literature in several universities, finally retiring from Jadavpur University as Professor of Bengali. 



Sankha Ghosh’s first collection of poems Dinguli Raatguli (The Days the Nights) was published in 1956. This was a period when Bangla poetry was taking an inward turn shifting from the socially and politically oriented poetry of the forties. The young poets of the fifties were less cynical than their predecessors, although perhaps inwardly more critical. Some of them showed signs of Baudelairean ennui and anguish. Not Sankha Ghosh. Many of his eminent contemporaries took to a kind of urban life practice that bordered on crossing socially permissible limits, as a metaphor of protest. Sankha Ghosh’s protest was of a different kind: his celebrated poem of this period was Jamunabati, written in the backdrop of a police firing on a food procession which formed a young girl dead. 



Sankha Ghosh, though close to the Krittibas group, did not share their life practices, nor did he explore city life in its bare physicality; his was a search for identity. In a longish poem invoking the ancient theme of Jabal Satyakam, he explores the question: what is my identity, mother? Boats are all unleashed, knots are cut with cruel axe. The Christmas party goes on. The woman leaves her glass on the table and lures someone for a stint of twist. The poison of my tongue gives the old beggar woman a nudge. All the cars, stop before the gory nails of the woman. What is my identity mother?



The beggar woman in these lines becomes a haunting image in Ghosh’s work, accumulating layers of meaning ranging from one’s own daughter to the entire motherland. His search for identity reaches new heights in the Gandharva poems (1994). This cycle of 36 poems are woven around the image of a plunge from the void above to the watery earth below. The poet as subject meditates between the poles of the high and the low. This has artistic implications as well: at a personal level this poet often comes down to the streets to raise funds in aid of the flood victims of a neighbouring country or to organize aid programmes for riot victims there and Aila victims here. Through this multi-levelled existence the poet seems to explore his personality. 

Sankha Ghosh is a major essayist and a foremost Tagore Scholar, as well as a writer for children and a translator. Some of his best-known writings on Tagore are Kaaler Maatraa O Rabindra Naatak (Dimension of time and Tagore play, 1969), Aamir Abaran (Veil over this Self, 1980) and Nirmaan Aar Smriti (Construction and Creation, 1982).



In his long career Ghosh has been awarded many honours. This includes Sahitya Akademi Award, 1977, Rabindra Purashkar, 1989, KamalKumari Puraskar, 1982, Kabir Samman, 1998, Saraswati Samman, 1998, and the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 2011.
