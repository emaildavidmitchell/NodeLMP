In the history of modern dance, Doris Humphrey’s significance traverses performance, choreography, pedagogy, and advocacy for the emerging art form in mid-century America. Her explorations of natural movement drew on principles she identified as ‘fall and recovery’, the yielding and resistance to the gravitational pull of the body. Humphrey’s predominant concern was the creation of ensemble dances, with signature works such as New Dance and Passacaglia coming out of residencies at the Bennington Summer School of the Dance. Her choreographic emphases lay in design, form, structure and lyricism alongside fluid musical dancing. The Humphrey-Weidman Company, which she co-directed with Charles Weidman, performed extensively in New York City and nationally between 1928 and 1946, bringing this new form of dance to the American people. From 1946 until her death in 1958, Humphrey served as artistic director of the Jose Limón Dance Company. John Martin, dance critic of the New York Times, said of her, ‘Doris Humphrey is an enduring part of the dance in America, as the granite under the soil is enduring. We can turn nowhere in the art without finding her’.

Training and Career

‘My dance is an art concerned with human values. It upholds only those values that make for harmony and opposes all forces inimical to those values. In part, its movement may be used for decoration, entertainment, emotional release or technical display: but primarily it is composed as an expression of American life as I see it today’.



Humphrey enjoyed an eclectic childhood exposure to dance and music, ranging from ballet, piano, tap dancing and vaudeville to training in expressive movement with the noted educator Mary Wood Hinman. It was Hinman who encouraged Humphrey to go to Los Angeles at age eighteen to work with Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn. Humphrey quickly became a valued member of the Denishawn Company, dancing leading roles and teaching at the Denishawn School for ten years. As Humphrey’s choreographic experience grew, so did her desire to find a creative voice beyond Denishawn's repertoire. This deep-seated need to pursue her own choreographic ideals led her to join forces with fellow ‘Denishawnites’ Charles Weidman and Pauline Lawrence: the three left the company in 1928 to set up their own studio in New York City. 



The Humphrey-Weidman studio, located first on East 59th Street and later on West 18th Street, was the fulcrum around which the two choreographers explored and developed their independent creative voices. Managed by Lawrence, the company performed regularly in New York and toured the country for many years. Notable engagements included concerts at the 92nd Street YMHA and summer residencies at the Bennington School of the Dance in Vermont. In exchange for teaching at the summer school, Bennington provided space and time for experimentation away from the pace of the city, as well as willing dancing bodies for the choreographers. Key figures in attendance alongside the modern dance pioneers - Humphrey, Weidman, Graham and Holm - included Louis Horst and other contemporary composers such as Wallingford Reigger whose music was commissioned by both Graham and Humphrey.



After she and Weidman parted ways in 1946, Humphrey became artistic director of the Jose Limón Company. The on-going relationship with her foremost protégé gave Humphrey a creative outlet and, at the same time, allowed her to support Limón’s career as an independent choreographer. She produced one of her most celebrated works, Day on Earth (1947), for the quartet of Limón, Letitia Ide, acknowledged as perhaps the finest of the Humphrey-Weidman dancers, and Betty Jones, who was to become one of the great Limón exponents. Day on Earth reflects on the cycle of love and work through the prism of a single family. Intertwined with this narrative is a significant artistic shift, as one generation merges with the next, as captured in the dancing of Ide and Jones. During this period Humphrey also taught composition and repertory at the Juilliard School in New York City, with many of her students going on to perform with the Limón Company. A number of her lectures at Juilliard were recorded and are transcribed in the appendix of Selma Jeanne Cohen’s biography of Humphrey, An Artist First.



Major Contribution to the Field and to Modernism

‘This new dance of action comes inevitably from the people who had to subdue a continent, to make a thousand paths through forest and plain, to conquer the mountains, and eventually to raise up towers of steel and glass. The American dance is born of this new world, new life, and new vigor’.



Humphrey’s philosophy on life and on dance reflected her inherent idealism that the human condition was ultimately pre-disposed toward good. This sentiment was a dominant theme in her work, although her means of expression were rarely literal and never sentimental. Humphrey’s primary artistic concern was to make dances of her time, indigenous to her American roots. 



Two early examples illustrate the breadth of her creativity. Humphrey’s choreographic emphasis could be on design and form, as in Water Study (1928), her first major post-Denishawn ensemble work and radical at the time for its absence of accompaniment or sound beyond the natural breath patterns of the dancers as they moved through a series of successional motifs that took on the form of moving water. Alternately, her emphasis could shift from nature to a socio-cultural context, with design and form still at the center of her composition, as in The Shakers (1931), inspired by a religious sect that had taken hold in America in the 1800s. Humphrey’s choreographic design captures aspects of Shakerism – a sense of line, order, structure, balance – as her choreographic vocabulary moves from quiet contemplation to ecstatic release. Water Study and The Shakers were amongst Humphrey’s most popular dances throughout the 1930s and 40s, and continue to be performed by contemporary companies in the USA and Europe.



From the mid-1930s, Bennington became a summer retreat for the New York-based modern dance choreographers. It is no surprise, therefore, that a number of Humphrey’s best known works are associated with this period, including New Dance (1935), With My Red Fires (1936) and Passacaglia (1938). These particular dances are illuminating examples of Humphrey’s concerns for the larger society, on the one hand, and for the possibilities for the human body in ensemble form, on the other hand. To Wallingford Reigger’s exhilarating modernist scores, New Dance was a positive affirmation of humankind existing in harmony. In contrast was With My Red Fires, a study of possessive and destructive matriarchal love and the manipulation of the mass. Passacaglia, set to Bach’s Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor, is regarded as her greatest work, and by some observers as her response to the rise of fascism that preceded the Second World War. As Humphrey wrote in the program note, ‘The dance was inspired by the need for love, tolerance and nobility in a world given more and more to the denial of these things’.



Humphrey had eclectic musical influences, spanning Bach (a recurring favourite), Beethoven and Grieg to the modernist composers of her own generation, including Dane Rhudyar (The Call/Breath of Fire, 1929), Wallingford Reigger (New Dance trilogy, 1935 - 36), Aaron Copland (Day on Earth, 1947) and Norman Lloyd (Invention, 1949). 



Humphrey’s later work continued to reflect her life-long concerns. Dawn in New York (1956), for example, was inspired by a Garcia Lorca poem that describes the New York dawn as ‘four columns of mud and a hurricane of black doves’. Humphrey set youth and lyricism against the rigid strictures of city life to a score by Hunter Johnson. Her final work, fittingly, was a large ensemble piece set to Bach, Brandenburg Concerto No. 4, completed by Ruth Currier following Humphrey’s death in 1958.



Development of Technique

‘Since my dance is concerned with immediate human values, my basic technique lies in the natural movement of the body. One cannot express contemporary life without humanizing movement, as distinguished from the dehumanization of the ballet. The modern dancer must come down from the points to the bare foot in order to establish his human relations to gravity and reality’.



Between 1928 and 1931, Humphrey defined her movement philosophy as ‘fall and recovery’, the ‘giving into and rebound from gravity…the very core of all movement, in my opinion’. She further articulated her theories of movement as follows: ‘The desire to move stimulates organic matter to reach out from its centre of equilibrium’; ‘To fall is to yield; to recover is to re-affirm one’s power over gravity and oneself’; ‘Falling and recovering is the very stuff of movement, the constant flux which is going on in every living body all the time. I… instinctively responded very strongly to the exciting danger of the fall, and the repose and peace of recovery’. The emergence of these principles came through Humphrey's creative response to movement exploration. Subsequent development, essentially to train her dancers to perform her choreography, resulted in the evolution of a more structured vocabulary. Important elements are the gravitational pull, lyricism, successional flow, opposition, the idea of taking movement to its very edge, the constant play between balance and imbalance, the use of breath in a ‘whole body’ context in which the body’s surfaces take on the physiological action of the lungs in terms of expansion and subsidence. From an exploratory, experiential beginning, there now exists a codified dance technique taught on an increasingly wider scale through the work of former Humphrey-Weidman dancers such as Ernestine Stodelle and Nona Schurmann. 



Prominent dancers from the 1950s such as Betty Jones and Ruth Currier danced under Humphrey but also had Limón’s stylistic influence in their bodies. There was a perceptible change, therefore, in the feeling and quality of movement from the early Humphrey period of the 1930s to that of late Humphrey and early Limón. In a broad sense, Humphrey-based technique as taught by Stodelle is fluid, lyrical, expansive, with a core emphasis on breath rhythm and ‘whole body’ movement through the pelvic connection. Humphrey/Limón technique as taught by Currier was similarly fluid with the pelvic connection, but less expansive and possessed a greater emphasis on intricate gesture and rhythmic patterns, in keeping with the pedagogy of other Limón teachers, including Jeanne Yasko, Clay Taliaferro and Daniel Lewis. Yet Humphrey/Limon technique maintained the foundational principle of fall and recovery, Humphrey’s core innovation. 



Legacy

‘I wish my dance to reflect some experience of my own in relationship to the outside world; to be based on reality illumined by imagination; to be organic rather than synthetic; to call forth a definite reaction from my audience; and to make its contribution toward the drama of life’.



Humphrey's legacy resides in her technique, her works still performed in repertoire, her writings, and her choreographic vision. Humphrey’s foresight in having her work recorded in Labanotation has allowed many of her most significant works to survive, including Air For the G String, Water Study, Concerto in A Minor, Quasi Waltz, The Call/Breath of Fire, The Shakers, Two Ecstatic Themes, New Dance, With My Red Fires, Passacaglia, Day on Earth, Fantasy in Fugue, Ritmo Jondo and Dawn in New York. These are dances that continue to have the power to excite audiences. Generations of students have read Humphrey’s treatise on the craft of choreography, The Art of Making Dances (1959), and have experienced the basic principles of fall and recover in the studio. Her influence stretches wider, however. Choreographic emphases on design, form, structure and lyricism alongside fluid musical dancing can be seen in the work of choreographers such as Paul Taylor (who studied composition with Humphrey), Tricia Brown and Mark Morris. In this way, her modernism informs the post-modern and contemporary, substantiating John Martin’s claim that ‘we can turn nowhere in the art without finding her’.
