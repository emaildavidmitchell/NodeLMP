Sologub, Fyodor Kuzmich Teternikov (1863-1927)

СОЛОГУБ , ФЕДОР КУЗЬМИЧ ТЕТЕРНИКОВ

Symbolist poet, novelist, and playwright. Sologub was known for his Decadent style of writing and his elaborate personal mythology, centered around myths of the sun, light, and death. His best known work, The Petty Demon, thematizes banality and is deeply pessimistic. Born in St. Petersburg on March 1, 1863, died in Leningrad on December 5, 1927. Born Fyodor Kuzmich Teternikov, Sologub grew up in a poor family. He attended St. Petersburg Teachers' Instutute to become a teacher in the provinces and to support his struggling mother. Sologub taught throughout the 1880s and 1890s until he was able to support himself solely with his writing. In 1907 he moved to St. Petersburg to continue his writing career. In that same year The Petty Demon, was published and found immediate success. The novel was adapted into a play of the same name  two years later. In 1908 he married the translator Anastasia Chebotarevskaya.  After the October Revolution in 1917, Sologub's opportunities to publish diminished significantly, and he began to search for outlets for emigration. Tragically, days before he and his wife planned to emigrate to Estonia, his wife committed suicide. Sologub cancelled his plans to emigrate and remained in Petrograd until his death, making a living by writing translations and occupying various positions in the Leningrad Writers' Union.
