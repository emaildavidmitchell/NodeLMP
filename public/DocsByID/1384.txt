Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity)

The term Neue Sachlichkeit was coined by Gustav Hartlaub with his
exhibition: Neue Sachlichkeit. Deutsche Malerei seit dem Expressionismus
(New Objectivity. German Painting Since Expressionism) at the Kunsthalle
Mannheim in 1925 and is now used to describe a movement during the
politically, socially, and economically unstable years of the Weimar
Republic in Germany (1919-1933) that includes painting, photography,
design, and architecture (Rewald, 2006).

In architecture the term mainly relates to Neues Bauen (New Building) and
avant-garde currents of rationalist and functionalist modernism that
existed alongside conservative counterparts and expressionism. Among its
contributors in Germany were Walter Gropius, Otto Haesler, Ludwig
Hilberseimer, Ernst May, Hannes Meyer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Martin
Wagner. Architecture and design was created in order to fulfill objective
functions and not along the lines of personal taste, preexisting
historical, national, or regional styles. The Sache  the object, subject
matter  was scrutinized in order to fulfill its function and serve its
user best as possible. The way in which this was approached was sachlich 
objectively and factually  without emotional attachment to ways in which
the object was designed or used previously. Neue Sachlichkeit therefore was
an approach to design pursuing, but not always achieving, practicality,
suitability, and objectivity by setting aside all matters considered by its
practitioners as irrelevant (Schwartz, 1998 and Schmalenbach, 1940).

Architecture of the Neue Sachlichkeit is associated with buildings free of
ornament, representational features, consisting of simple geometry, and
shaped by inherent functions. Its contributors drew on theories already
apparent before World War I, such as on Adolf Loos 1910 essay Ornament
und Verbrechen (Ornament and Crime). German contributors related to
contemporary international avant-garde movements such as De Stijl, Russian
Constructivism, or Futurism and to practitioners such as Frank Lloyd Wright
and Le Corbusier. Architectural groups (Der Ring) and architectural
magazines (Das Neue Frankfurt, Die Form) also were founded in support
of this new movement (Curtis, 1996, Lampugnani, 1994).

To convince the public about the efficacy of the design critic Adolf Behne,
for example, compared the interiors of the 19th-century and of the
Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) to the interior of the Haus am Horn [Fig. 1]. A
clear, uncluttered interior was pursued because it was thought to be
beneficial for health and wellbeing. The Haus am Horn, as one of the
earliest examples of Neues Bauen, was built in 1923 by the Bauhaus in
Weimar [Fig. 2]. It was planned as a prototype that would fit the
requirements of the majority of home-seeking working-class tenants. While
it failed to achieve this goal in that it was considered too large and
expensive for the targeted clientele, its objective related to the new
social and ethical attitude to design in that architectural innovations
were sought to increase living standards of the working class.

This attitude to design arose in relation to the social and political
context of the time. A severe housing shortage, caused by 19th-century
housing politics and the First World War, made the development of mass
housing necessary and with it questions arose as to how to revolutionize
the building process to save time and costs, which new materials could be
used and developed, how much space could be allocated per person, and how
to envision the lifestyle of modern man. In the second half of the 1920s a
number of works then could be realized and in response to such questions.

In cities, that were most affected by the housing shortage, such as Berlin
[Fig. 3-4 + video] and Frankfurt, modern architects Martin Wagner (Berlin)
and Ernst May (Frankfurt) were appointed to build settlements for the
Existenzminumim on a great scale. In Mays team architects and designers
were involved such as Martin Elsaesser, Adolf Meyer, Ferdinand Kramer,
Leberecht Migge, Eugen Kaufmann, Margarete (Grete) Schtte-Lihotzky, Walter
Gropius, and Mart Stam. 15,000 apartments in settlements as well as
schools, churches, and parks were built between 1925 and 1930 in Frankfurt
alone [Fig. 5-7]. To achieve this, May developed Typengrundrisse [Fig. 5]
for different size families which would decrease building times and enable
standardization. These living spaces were reduced to a minimum but at the
same time it was ensured that each apartment would receive sunlight and
fresh air. Settlements were planned so that tenants had easy access to
green spaces, and public transport. Efforts to optimally shape each room
according to its functions resulted in the prediction and measurement of
movement inside the rooms. Grete Schtte-Lihotzkys Frankfurt Kitchen
[video] was developed to relieve the housewife by saving time and energy
for cooking and cleaning.

Walter Gropius was also concerned with the standardization and
prefabrication of building components, construction methods, and house
types as in the settlements in Dessau Trten (1926-28), Karlsruhe
Dammerstock (with Otto Haesler) (1928-29) and in his contribution to Berlin
Siemensstadt (1929-30) [Fig. 8-10 + video].

Hannes Meyer, second director of the Bauhaus and one of the left wing
representatives of the Neues Bauen, understood design as a social act. His
1928 manifesto bauen declared the house to be a biological apparatus for
spiritual and physical requirements, and that building was the organization
of social, technical, economic and psychological needs. His position
towards objective and functional design becomes also apparent in his
approach to teaching, in that he encouraged students to study the life
process of the user and to relate their design to specified requirements
(Meyer-Bergner, 1980).

To provide an international platform on which to test and compare
innovations the Deutsche Werkbund organized exhibitions in Stuttgart-
Weienhof (1927), organized by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, [Fig. 11 + video],
Breslau (1929), and Vienna [Fig. 12] (1932) at which architects were
invited to showcase their use of novel materials and building methods as
well as their vision of life in their dwellings.

The Great Depression of 1929 caused American banks to recall their loans to
Germany and during the ensuing worldwide economic crisis the building-boom
of the latter years ceased. Adolf Hitlers seizure of power and
establishment of a dictatorship in 1933 then put an end to the Neues Bauen
in Germany.

Even though manifestos and publications demanded a radical change in the
building process towards developing standardized building blocks or
housing machines, the modern buildings were mostly still erected with
traditional methods. Functionality or objectivity in design was at times
confused with simplicity in form, and theoretical claims were not always
achieved in practical application in that, for example, flat roofs could
not be constructed effectively, nor were they always weatherproof.
Theoretical utterances about the nature of Neues Bauen and Neue
Sachlichkeit were disparate and complex and the movement was not as unified
as historiography and proponents of this movement suggested.
