Treitschke, Heinrich von (1834-1896)
Heinrich Gotthard von Treitschke was a historian and political writer in
the German Empire. Born in Dresden, Treitschke studied in Leipzig, Bonn,
Tbingen and Freiburg and worked as a professor of history and politics at
Freiburg, Kiel and Heidelberg. Espousing liberal views, he supported German
unification under a parliamentary government. From 1871 to 1884, Treitschke
served as a member of the Reichstag (parliament of the German Empire),
first with the Nationalliberale Partei (National Liberal Party), later as a
conservative-leaning independent. In 1874 Treitschke was made professor at
Humboldt University in Berlin and shortly after official historiographer of
the Prussian state. Treitschkes idealizing interpretation of nineteenth
century German and Prussian history in the five volume Deutsche Geschichte
im 19. Jahrhundert (1879-1894; History of Germany in the Nineteenth
Century) became a popular classic among the German public and political
elites. As a leading German nationalist, Treitschke supported colonial
expansion and chauvinistic feelings against other nations. Treitschke also
produced vocal anti-Semitic tracts, arguing that German Jews refused to
assimilate into German culture and society. He is infamously known for the
quote The Jews are our misfortune, which was adopted by the Nazis several
decades later.
