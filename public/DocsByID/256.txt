Kay Boyle was a novelist, short story writer, poet, essayist and political activist. Born in St Paul, Minnesota, she married a Frenchman, Richard Brault, in 1922, and moved to France with him the following year. She then lived in Europe for most of the next twenty years, and her early novels frequently reflect her own experiences as an expatriate. Languid and impressionistic in style, her early prose work focuses on relationships between men and women. In later life she also became heavily involved in politics and her work took on a more urgent social tenor; for example, the 1936 novel Death of a Man alerted readers to the threat of Nazism.

Boyle remained a vigorous political campaigner throughout her life. She was most celebrated in her lifetime for her short stories, and won the O. Henry prize in 1935, for ‘The White Horses of Vienna’, and in 1941, for ‘Defeat’. Her best known work is Being Geniuses Together; begun by the author and publisher Robert McAlmon in 1934, Boyle revised and added alternate chapters after McAlmon’s death. The book chronicles the literary and artistic milieu of Paris in the 1920s, in which Boyle was a central figure.
