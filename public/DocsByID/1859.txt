Sri Sri published Prabava, his first collection of poems, when he was eighteen. The ‘Hungry Thirties’ and the political turbulence of the times transformed him radically, and the poems he wrote in that decade, later published in the collection Mahaaprastanam (1950), gave a new direction to Telugu poetry and attracted criticism from conservative readers. The volume sounded a clarion call for revolt against all forms of socio-economic exploitation. The poems ‘Jayaberi’ (1930) and ‘Mahaprasthanam’ (The Great Journey, 1934) reflect the poet’s optimism about a revolutionary future. 



Sri Sri openly embraced political function literature and welcomed a wide spectrum of, at times contradictory, trends in poetry ranging from surrealism to Digambara, or naked poetry. While he had a deep engagement with Marxist literature, Sri Sri also introduced strands of literary modernism such as Dadaism, Surrealism, Expressionism and Existentialism to the world of Telugu literature. His work drew inspiration from several modern poetic traditions, and was marked by influence of poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Paul Eluard, Louis Aragon, Mayakovsky, and Dylan Thomas.



Sri Sri’s work had a major impact on the conception of poetry and poets among Telugu readers and critics. Apart from Mahaprasthanam, his major works include Maroprasthanam, Siprali and Khadga Srushti. Maroprasthanam marked a new turn in Sri Sri’s poetry towards the common man’s language, with the poems acquiring greater lucidity and a tone of prophesy. Sri Sri tried his hand at a wide range of forms of literature like lyric, sketch, play-let and fiction, thus contributing to the consolidation of these forms in modern Telugu literature. He was also a screenwriter for several Telugu films, and penned more than a thousand lyrics for movies.



Sri Sri was on the forefront of the two important literary movements—progressive and revolutionary—in Telugu. He played a major role in the formation of the Revolutionary Writers Association, which proclaimed Marxism, Leninism and Mao Tse-Tung Thought as its worldview. He was the President of the Association in 1971.



Sri Sri did not confine his activities to the world of literature; he also actively engaged in politics. He participated in the Communist Party's election campaigns and was elected to the legislative assembly. He was active in the world peace movement and visited Helsinki, Paris and Moscow. He received the Sahitya Akademi award and the Soviet Land Nehru award in 1972.
