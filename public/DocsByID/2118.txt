Wood, Beatrice (1893-1998)							Word Count: 228

	An American potter known for luster-glaze chalices and whimsical ceramic figures, Beatrice Wood was once named the ‘Mama of Dada’. Born into a wealthy family in San Francisco, California on 3 March 1893, raised in New York City, and a student at the Académie Julian in Paris, by 1912 Wood had rebelled at her traditional upbringing. Seeking a more bohemian life, she joined avant-garde art circles, became friends with Marcel Duchamp and Henri-Pierre Roché, and was influential in the New York Dada movement. During the 1930s, her early successes in ceramics provided independent income, By 1948 she had settled in Ojai, California, moving there to continue her interest in Theosophy. She established a studio developing embedded luster glazes with radiant colors and continued in this work for over thirty years. Wood was recognised as a California Living Treasure by her native state, named an Esteemed American Artist by the Smithsonian Institution, and was inspiration in part for the character of Rose in the 1997 film Titanic (beatricewood.com). She died on March 12, 1998 at the age of 105.
