Krpfl, Francisco (1931- )
Laura Novoa

Francisco Krpfl is an Argentinean composer and researcher.  His work  as  a
pedagogue through the development of several generations of  Latin  American
composers is widely  recognized,  alongside  his  intense  activity  in  the
diffusion of 20th-century music through the  Agrupacin  Nueva  Msica  (New
Music Group), founded by Juan Carlos Paz, of whom  Krpfl  was  a  follower.
Specializing  in  electroacoustic  music,  Krpfl  has  been  a  pioneer  in
composition with electronic media.  In  1958,  he  founded  the  Estudio  de
Fonologa Musical (EFM)  at  the  University  of  Buenos  Aires,  the  first
laboratory of  its  kind  in  Latin  America.   He  subscribes  to  integral
serialism (the employment of series for aspects other than  pitch,  such  as
duration), an orientation he has applied in an original and personal  manner
in his works. Krpfl has explored the  expressive  potential  of  the  human
voice both in his works for voice and as an instrumental  accompaniment.  In
this vein, Orillas (1988) became a paradigmatic work, earning him  the  1988
Magistre Prize in Bourges, France.   He  was  president  of  the  Argentine
Federation of Electroacoustic Music and  judged  international  competitions
of electroacoustic music.

Of Hungarian origin and a nationalized Argentine, Francisco Krpfl was  born
in Tamisoara (Romania) in 1931 and came to  Argentina  with  his  family  in
1932. His early musical studies with Hungarian teachers took  place  between
1940 and 1947.  His early  compositions,  using  a  free  atonal  discourse,
reveal the  influence  of  the  Second  Viennese  School  (Schnberg,  Berg,
Webern).  Msica  para  clarinete  y  flauta  (1951)  was  the  first  piece
composed under the tutelage  of  Juan  Carlos  Paz,  with  whom  he  studied
composition between  1948  and  1953.  Afterwards  they  remained  in  touch
through the activities of diffusion of the works  of  the  Agrupacin  Nueva
Msica (New Music Association).

Although Krpfl began to employ the dodecaphonic  technique  in  the  second
piece of the Dos piezas lricas para piano  (1949)  and  in  Tres  canciones
(1951), his first entirely dodecaphonic pieces are the Tres  Piezas  Fciles
(1952).  To this same period belong the Cuatro  canciones  de  Aldo  Maranca
(1952) for voice, flute and clarinet, the third piece  being  based  on  the
rhythmic organization  techniques  of  Pierre  Boulez.   Inspired  by  Anton
Webern, Krpfl wrote Variaciones para piano (1953), his first  serial  piece
(serial in rhythm, pitch and intensity), which he subsequently  reworked  in
the Cuarteto mixto (1953) for clarinet, mute trumpet, viola and piano.

The years between  1956  and  1958  are  definitive  for  understanding  the
development of Krpfls  ideas,  as  well  as  his  subsequent  output.  The
technical principles of integral serialism were  transmitted  to  Krpfl  by
Pierre Boulez in a series of meetings of the two in Buenos  Aires  in  1954;
Krpfl began to apply his own version in Una cancin para  Bartono  (1955),
and then in Msica 1956 (1956) for solo clarinet,  and  in  a  more  organic
fashion in Msica 1957 (1957) for soprano, guitar,  vibraphone,  piano,  and
percussion.  Although in Msica  1957  Krpfl  considered  the  idea  in  an
organic, integral form for the first time,  the  first  strongly  systematic
organization of all parameters becomes concrete in Msica 1958 for piano.

Krpfl  was  acquainted  with  the  earliest  electronic   compositions   of
Stockhausen, Berio and Maderna. In 1958, he  wrote  the  prologue  for,  and
translated (with Guillermo Lcke), Elektronische  Musik  by  Eimer  et  al.,
which was the first edition in Spanish of  the  Cuaderno  I  of  Die  Reihe.
That same year, he founded  the  Estudio  de  Fonologa  Musical,  which  he
presided over until its closure in 1973.  He  also  started  composing  with
electronic media in Ejerccio  de  Impulsos  and  Ejercicio  Electrnico  de
Texturas (both 1959), Ejercicio de Ruido Blanco  (1960).  Dialogos  I  y  II
(Dialogs I and II) as well as Mutacin I (1969),  reveal  Krpfls  keenness
to find an integral form  through  the  continuous  modulation  of  distinct
dimensions of the sound material.   Msica  para  Sintetizador  (1970),  the
last piece he  composed  at  the  EFM,  was  composed  with  a  synthethizer
controlled by voltage, designed and built at EFM, and  completely  novel  to
Latin America.

During this period, he also worked with traditional instruments  and  became
interested in the relationship between image and  sound.   Dimension  (1960)
(for two guitars, piano, and percussion) is the  music  for  a  short  film.
Here,  Krpfl  applied  the  principles  of  Stockhausens  formant   rhythm
technique,  together  with   Joseph   Schillingers   principle   of   wave
interference.  He also produced the music for Flash Gordon  in  the  Frozen
Kingdom (1968), presented at the Di Tella Institute in the  context  of  the
Bienal Internacional de la Historieta.

In the mid-1960s, Krpfl drew away from serialism and started to  experiment
with some of the eras aesthetics.  He explored analogic notation in  Msica
1966 (1966), graphic scores in  Variations  on  December  1952  (1966),  and
aleatory techniques in Esquemas de Improvisacin Grupal  (1967/69).

While  teaching  between  1967  and  1971  as  Professor  of  the  Chair  of
Electronic music and acting as director of  the  laboratory  of  CLAEM,  the
Centro Latinoamericano de Altos Estudios Musicales (Latinamerican Center  of
Musical Higher Studies) of the Di Tella Institute, he  contributed  to  give
shape and  organicity  for  the  teaching  and  composition  of  music  with
electronic media.  He has been influential in the generation of  a  valuable
corpus of foundational pieces of Latin American composers.

When CLAEM shut down and  its  equipment  was  transferred  to  CICMAT,  the
Centro de Investigacin en Comunicacin  Masiva,  Arte  y  Tecnologa  (Mass
Communication,  Art  and  Technology  Research  Center),  Krpfl   continued
teaching young composers interested in  electroacoustic  music  (while  also
directing the Contemporary Music  Department  between  1972  and  1977)  and
there produced Tnicas y Giros (1973) and Pequeos Seres (1973),  his  first
work with a synththizer (an ARP one).

He was awarded the Guggenheim fellowship (1977  1978). Before  leaving  for
the United States and Europe, he composed Tro 1977, Msica 1974  for  flute
and  piano  and,  with  Gustavo  Beytelmann,  the  film  musical  score  for
Quebracho  (1974).   At  Columbia-Princeton  Universities   laboratory,   he
produced three electronic  pieces,  Nocturno  (1977),  Scherzo  (1977),  and
Msica para Percusin (Music for  percussion)  (1997).   On  his  return  to
Buenos  Aires  he  explored  music  for  computers  with   Ejercicios   para
computadora (1979).

Krpfls  teaching  work,  focused  on  the  analysis  and  composition   of
twentieth-century  music,  intensifiedin  the  eighties,  the  same  period
during which his fundamental ideas aboutthe organizationof rhythm and  the
micromodes and hexachordal modes were widely spread. At the  same  time,  he
became the director of LIPM, the Laboratorio de Investigacin  y  Produccin
Musical (Laboratory of Research and Production  of  Music),  inaugurated  in
1982,   which   reached   international   prestige   through   programs   of
collaboration and exchange with similar institutions in  the  United  States
of America and in Europe.

   A persistent streak in Krpfls music and  verifiable  in,  for  example,
   Tres  Improvisaciones  (1983)  for  flute,  in  Polimonoda  para  cuatro
   instrumentos (1984), Pequeo requiem para una voz (Tiny requiem  for  one
   voice) (1986), Tres poemas de Lorca, Ballet (1987) and Orillas,   is  the
   mutation of the material,  the  transformations  of  which  reorient  the
   formal direction of the work.


   Between 1987 and 2005, Krpfl received commissions  from  Cologne  Radio,
   Germany (WDR); from the French republic; and from INA-GRM, LIEM and  IMEB
   to compose pieces of electroacoustic  music.  These  included  Metrpolis
   Buenos Aires. Temas y Variaciones  sobre  una  ciudad  (1989),  a  sound
   picture of the city of Buenos Aires; Espejo Distorsionante  (1994);  the
   mapuche indigenous peoples trilogy Vientos  (1996), Al Sur   (1997)  and
   El Regreso  (2000); El pjaro  (1995); El vuelo (2000); and Lento come le
   algue (2005).


   Krpfl  retired  from  institutional  public  activity   in   2006.   His
   instrumental production has increased since 2000 as new commissions  have
   been received. He has written trios for various groups (Trio 02, Trio  03
   and Trio 08); a Quartet Number 2b (2006) for strings, flute, French  horn
   and trumpet; Divergencias (2007) for ten instruments; and  Relato  (2006)
   for reciter, flute, clarinet, violin, and violoncello.  Amongst his  most
   recent works is La tercera es la vencida (2011),  a  staged  divertimento
   with lyrics by Oscar Steinberg.
