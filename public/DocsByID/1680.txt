Ryan, Oscar (1904-1989)

The leading cultural activist in the Canadian Communist party in the 1930s,
Oscar Ryan was the formative figure in the Workers Theatre movement in
Canada and a tireless advocate of revolutionary theatrical modernism. Born
Oscar Weinstein, he took his underground name from his mothers maiden
name, Rein. He grew up in Montreal and Winnipeg and after high school
joined the Young Communist League as a full-time party activist. With an
idiomatic and forceful proletarian writing style in the manner of John Dos
Passos and Mike Gold, he became a writer for the Communist Partys Daily
Worker and its successors, the Daily Clarion and the Canadian Tribune. As
Martin Stone, he was a theatre critic for the Tribune from 1955 to 1988. In
the Communist Party of Canada, he was an early supporter of Tim Buck, who
took over the party in 1929 when communist parties around the world assumed
a more radical militant stance in answer to Stalins call for revolutionary
class war. Under Buck, Ryan became a leading figure in the partys
propaganda wing, a cultural organizer, publicity director of the Canadian
Labor Defence League, and the author of numerous pamphlets. His published
work includes the agitprop play Unity (1932), the novel Soon to be Born
(1980), and a hagiographic biography of Tim Buck. At Ryans initiative and
direction, the Toronto Workers Theatre wrote and produced the first major
Canadian documentary agitprop play, Eight Men Speak (1933); Ryan was one of
four co-authors.

Considered the high point of revolutionary modernism in Canadian theatre,
Eight Men Speak combined familiar agitprop techniques of mass chant,
spotlight dramaturgy, telegraphic dialogue, and parody with documentary
realism as part of a campaign to advocate for the release of imprisoned
Communist leaders. Ryan was the principal director of the play, and played
the iconic figure of the Workers Judge. The Toronto police, on orders
from the Prime Minister of Canada, banned the play after its first
performance; Ryans attempt to remount it in Winnipeg the following year
was also aborted by police intervention.

Ryan met his life partner, Toby Gordon, in the Workers Theatre and married
in 1949. Toby Gordon Ryans memoir, Stage Left is the most complete, if
politically circumspect, account of the Workers Theatre and the production
of Eight Men Speak.
