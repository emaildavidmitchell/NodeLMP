Arne Garborg is one of the most prominent Norwegian writers  of  the  latter
half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th  century.  He  was  among
the first to write in Norways second  official  language,  landsml  (later
nynorsk), and his production ranges from novels  to  short  stories,  poems,
drama, newspaper articles, and essays. Many of his early works are  embedded
in the Scandinavian Modern Breakthrough and  Naturalism.  In  the  1890s  he
turned  to  a  more  psychologically  oriented  writing,  also  inspired  by
literary decadence  and  by  an  emergent  Modernism.  Garborg  was  one  of
Norways major interpreters of a  conflict  between  old  and  new  ways  of
thinking literature, religion and society. He was married to  the  Norwegian
writer Hulda Garborg.

Arne Garborg was born in 1851 in the rural  district  of  Jren  in  Western
Norway. He spent his youth working on the farm belonging  to  his  pietistic
family. His rural and strictly religious  upbringing  left  a  mark  in  his
personality and came to play an important  role  in  his  later  works.  His
literary debut, Ein Fritenkjar (1881), is one of the  first  novels  written
in landsml and focuses on the struggle  between  religious  dogmas  and  an
increasingly secularized world. Bondestudentar (The Making of Daniel  Braut,
1883) is a classic of Norwegian Naturalism and tells the  story  of  Daniel,
who leaves his village in search  of  an  education  at  the  University  of
Kristiania (todays Oslo). The novel shows Daniels problematic  search  for
identity: his social ambitions through education end up with a  betrayal  of
his own class. Garborg returned to such crises  of  the  individual  in  the
decadent novel Trtte Mnd (Weary Men, 1891), where he portraits  three  men
who try to cope with the  crisis  of  values  of  the  fin  de  sicle.  The
conflict between religion and society is at stake in one of  Garborgs  most
important novels, Fred (Peace, 1892), which depicts the course of  the  hero
Enok, increasingly devoured by a Pietist faith that brings him  to  suicide.
In  the  1890s,  Garborgs  production  took  a  psychological  and  lyrical
direction, especially with  the  poetic  cycle  Haugtussa  (1895),  and  the
novels Den burtkomne Faderen (The  Lost  Father,  1899)  and  Heimkomin  Son
(1908). During  his  whole  life  Garborg  worked  for  the  development  of
landsml as a literary language, and, in later years, he translated  several
classics of  world  literature  into  landsml,  such  as  the  Odyssey  and
Ramayana. Although increasingly  plagued  by  depression,  he  continued  to
write until his death, especially non-fiction. Having travelled  extensively
in Europe throughout his life, he died in his native district in 1924.
