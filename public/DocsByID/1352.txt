Naghi, Mohamed Musa (1888-1956)

The painter Mohamed Naghi is remembered today alongside Mahmoud Mukhtar
(1891-1934) and Mahmoud Said (1897-1964) as one of the core members of the
so-called first generation of Egyptian artists. His early nationalist
paintings executed after the Uprising of 1919 won him recognition.
Paintings produced in 1931-32 while Naghi was in Ethiopia brought him
further acclaim. After the system of foreign privileges was abolished in
1937, a number of Egyptian artists, including Naghi, were assigned high-
ranking positions in state art institutions. A Pioneer artist, Mohamed
Naghi sought to develop a school of modern Egyptian art that was true to
what he perceived as arts universal foundations (and especially an
equilibrium both formal and moral in nature) and the roots of an Egyptian
identity grounded in a metaphysics of the collective. Like many of his
contemporaries, his work drew on motifs referencing the art and
intellectual history of Pharaonic Egypt, Egypts Islamic Golden Age, and a
shared culture of the Mediterranean basin, as well as important
contemporary literary and artistic figures. However, it was his interest in
Egyptian folk art (al-fann al-shaabi) that would prove most influential
for subsequent generations. Despite early setbacks in his dealings with the
art establishment, he eventually became a powerful figure in Egypts new
state arts sector and argued for the need for state intervention in
cultivating an Egyptian artistic renaissance.

Naghi was born in Alexandria on January 17, 1888 to an affluent family with
a record of service in the Egyptian army and civil administration. After
receiving a law degree at the University of Lyon (1906-1910), he enrolled
at the Institute of Fine Arts in Florence (the Scuola Libera del Nudo,
Instituto di Belle Arti) from 1910 to 1914. While a student in France and
Italy, Naghi frequented local museums and created reproductions of major
works. With an eye to more recent developments in the arts, he also
produced paintings that engaged with the work of Divisionist painters
active in northern Italy in the 1890s and early 1900s. In the same period,
Naghi began taking extended trips to Luxor with the aim of immersing
himself in the arts of Ancient Egypt. The outbreak of World War I in 1914
forced Naghi to cut his art studies in Florence short and return to Egypt.

In 1918 he spent time at an artistss colony in Giverny, where he hoped to
apprentice himself to the eminent if now elderly Impressionist master,
Claude Monet (1840-1926). The 1919 Uprising inspired his return to Egypt,
where he painted Egyptian Renaissance (Renaissance dgypte, also Mawkab
Isis, or La Cortge dIsis, 1919. Now destroyed. Oil paint, dimensions
unknown.) which hung for decades in Cairos Senate (Majlis al-Shiyukh). He
later described the work as a first attempt at creating an Egyptian
pictorial art. A series of paintings produced in 1931 and 1932, during a
year spent in Ethiopia at the imperial court of Haile Selassie, yielded a
number of subsequent high-profile exhibitions in Egypt and Europe.

In 1935, he co-founded the Alexandria Atelier, which almost immediately
exerted a powerful influence on the local scene. From 1937 to 1939, he
served as the head of the Higher School of Fine Arts; from 1939 to 1947 he
occupied the position of director of the Museum of Modern Art in Cairo;
between 1947 and 1950 he took on the post of director of the Royal Egyptian
Academy in Rome. In 1953, following his return to Egypt, he co-founded the
Cairo Atelier. The Naghi Museum was inaugurated at the late artists studio
in Giza on July 13, 1968.
