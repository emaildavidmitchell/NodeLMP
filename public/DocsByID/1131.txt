Lin Yutang (1895-1976)

Lin Yutang (林语堂) was a major figure in the development of twentieth-century Chinese modernity. He was a scholar, inventor, educator and translator, as well as a writer who explored themes of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism in books disseminated widely in China and the West. Born into a Chinese Presbyterian minister’s family in the province of Fujian, Lin Yutang was educated in comparative literature and philology (including doctoral studies) at universities in Shanghai, Boston (Harvard) and Leipzig. As a professor at Peking University (1923-1926) and university administrator in China (1926), Lin became renowned for promoting western literature, thought and technology, whilst also working to disseminate classic Chinese literature in the West. He supervised the production of a Chinese-English dictionary and patented the Ming Kuai Chinese typewriter (明快中文打字机) in 1946, advancing Chinese print culture. Lin’s prolific output of fiction, nonfiction and journalism (http://bit.ly/OR9lpV) includes Moment in Peking (Jing Hua Yan Yun) (1939), a novel written in English about China’s revolutionary history and Between Tears and Laughter (Ti Xiao Jie Fei) (1943), a novel dedicated to American writer and Nobel Prize winner Pearl S. Buck and her publisher husband Richard J. Walsh (http://bit.ly/O7mZ6P).
