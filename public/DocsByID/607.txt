American author John Fante (April 8, 1909  May 8, 1983) is best known for
his Arturo Bandini novels, including The Road to Los Angeles (written 1933,
published 1985), Wait Until Spring, Bandini (1938), Dreams from Bunker Hill
(published 1982), and in particular Ask the Dust (1939). While his interwar
novels and short stories were met with critical acclaim, he found far more
financial success working for the film industry, where he wrote scripts for
figures such as Orson Welles while socializing with other contract writers
such as William Faulkner. His highly autobiographical fiction frequently
showed the influence of, and made reference to, figures like Friedrich
Nietzsche and H. L. Mencken. His work dealt largely with the experiences of
working-class Americans of Italian descent and their interactions with
other marginalized groups, particularly Filipinos, Mexicans, and Jews.

Titled after a line from Knut Hamsuns Pan (Cooper 166), Ask the Dust is
considered emblematic of 1930s Los Angeles. The novel opens with what are
perhaps Fantes most famous lines:

            One night I was sitting on the bed in my hotel room on Bunker
Hill, down
           in the very middle of Los Angeles. It was an important night in
      my life,
           because I had to make a decision about the hotel. Either I paid
           up or I got out: that was what the note said, the note the
           landlady had put under my door. A great problem, deserving acute
           attention. I solved it by turning out the lights and going to
           bed. (7)

Fantes works have enjoyed a recent critical and popular resurgence, in
large part due to celebration of the author by later figures such as
Charles Bukowski  who mentioned Fante in novels, poems, and interviews 
and successful reissues from Black Sparrow Press in the 1980s.
