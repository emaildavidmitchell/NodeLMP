Scott, Michael (1905-1989)



Michael Scott was the foremost proponent of Modern architecture in Ireland during the mid 20th century. He specialised in public commissions, particularly hospitals and transport hubs, as well as private houses. His rural hospital designs in the late 1920s and 1930s were influenced by Finnish and Dutch work by ALVAR AALTO and J.J.P. OUD, emphasising linear horizontal masses, often finished with decorative limestone cladding. He was responsible for promoting the International Style to both Irish architects and the Irish government from the 1930s, and designed the award-winning Irish Pavilion at the 1939 New York WORLD’S FAIR (see Fig. 1). His later work was characterised by the sculptural use of white concrete forms, as in his own home Geragh (see Fig 2), and the integration of artwork, bringing colour and texture into his buildings. He is best known for the CORBUSIAN design of the Dublin central bus depot Busáras, which used asymmetric organic shapes and incorporated coloured mosaic into the exterior (see Fig. 3). He influenced several generations of Irish architects through his practice (now Scott Tallon Walker), and was awarded the RIBA Gold Medal for Promotion of Architecture on his retirement in 1975.
