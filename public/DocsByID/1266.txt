Leberecht Migge

Leberecht Migge (1881 Danzig [now Gdansk, Poland]  1935 Flensburg,
Germany) was a German landscape architect and writer. During his early
career he collaborated with architects such as Hermann Muthesius and Henry
van de Velde, who were among the pioneers of Modernism before World War I
and founding members of the influential Deutscher Werkbund (1907-1934, 1950-
), a German association of architects, designers and industrialist that
Migge also joined in 1912.

During the 1920s Migge worked on large-scale settlement projects with Bruno
Taut and Martin Wagner in Berlin (Onkel Toms Htte, 1926-31 and Berlin-
Britz aka Hufeisensiedlung, 1925-31) and with Ernst May in Frankfurt am
Main (Rmerstadt, 1926-30).

The economic crisis after World War I had led to a severe housing shortage
and in Berlin, as in Frankfurt, large-scale building programmes were
initiated to improve the living conditions of the working class. To enable
tenants to supplement their diets with nutritious foods, to make them less
dependent on fluctuating prices, and to provide spaces for exercise,
gardens were incorporated in the overall plans of these new settlements
[Figs. 1-4].

Migge had visited England and Ebenezer Howards 1898 book Garden Cities of
To-Morrow, as well as the Garden City Movement and the executed garden city
of Letchworth, were influential in the development of Migges design
theories for urban gardens. Central to Migges landscape design theories
was the aim to provide gardens for urban dwellers to make them self-
sufficient and to remove traditional and hierarchical notions of gardens
and parks as being exclusively for the use of the privileged classes.

Migges collaboration on some of the most influential settlements during
the 1920s in Germany as well as the large number and success of his
publications and completed projects made him one of the most prolific
landscape architects of his time.
