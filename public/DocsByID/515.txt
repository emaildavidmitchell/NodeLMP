Born in Southern Illinois, Ed Dorn marks the trail westward for Black Mountain. He followed the advice of mentor Charles Olson ‘to dig’ a subject tirelessly to understand the broader strokes of poetry, politics, race, and economics in the mid-twentieth century. The assignment took him across the West where Dorn dug into the culture and daily living of this iconic region and brought forth, among other works, the four-part epic narrative Gunslinger. Marjorie Perloff refers to Slinger as the ‘great’ example of a mid-century long narrative poem. Polemical, political, and intellectual, Dorn also edited Bean News and Rolling Stock. He secured most of his income by lecturing and teaching across the United States and England, giving rise to transatlantic collaboration and friendships with British poets and critics Donald Davie, Tom Raworth, and J. H. Prynne.
