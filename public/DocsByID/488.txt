Sirk, Douglas (1900–1987)

Detlef Sierck

Douglas Sirk was a German émigré director widely celebrated for his melodramas produced for Universal through the 1950s that inspired generations of critics and filmmakers. In his commercially successful and critical acclaimed works such as Magnificent Obsession (1954), All that Heaven Allows (1955), and Written on the Wind (1957), Sirk reinvented American suburbia as a perfect dramatic setting where individuals struggled against bourgeois norms and invasive modern technology. Sirk’s films are the hallmark for Hollywood melodramas in which thematic use of music, colour, and costumes propel the drama to a boiling point.

Sirk’s films are the hallmark for Hollywood melodramas in which thematic use of music, colour, and costumes propel the drama to a boiling point. 



Born Hans Detlef Sierck in Hamburg to Danish parents, Douglas Sirk studied law, philosophy and art history in Munich, Jena, and Hamburg during the socially unstable post-WWI years, before starting a successful career in theatre. From a dramatist at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg in 1921, he worked his way up to the positions of art director and director. Through his staging of Bertolt Brecht’s Die Dreigroschenoper (Three Penny Opera) in Bremen, he met the director G. W. Pabst, and visited Ufa’s studio. In 1934, Ufa recruited Sirk after his successful direction of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night in Berlin. As Detlef Sierck, he directed eight films for Ufa, before abandoning his promising career in order to flee Nazi Germany with his Jewish wife Hilde Jary. 



Arriving in the United States via Switzerland and Holland, Sirk struggled to find work. After his fruitless contract with Warner Bros., he had a short stint as a writer at Columbia. It was through fellow European émigrés that Sirk found a foothold in Hollywood. For the émigré producers Seymour Nebenzal and Rudolf Joseph, Sirk directed the anti-Nazi propaganda film, Hitler’s Madman (1943), and the Chekhov adaptation, Summer Storm (1944). For Arnold Pressburger, he directed A Scandal in Paris (1946). Moving to Universal in 1950, Sirk found his audience, and a popular formula for glossy star-studded films that featured Rock Hudson (and later his protégé John Gavin), Jane Wyman and Barbara Stanwyck among others. Sirk worked within the studio system, working with scripts that were given to him by the producers: both The Magnificent Obsession (1954) and Imitation of Life (1959) were remakes of Universal’s melodramas from the mid-1930s directed by John Stahl. 



At the height of his popularity in the United States in 1959, Sirk returned to Europe, resuming his work in theatre. It was also in this period that Sirk’s films were revalorized by advocates of the auteur theory who noted Sirk’s distinct aesthetic vision, which elevated his works above the common melodramas, or ‘weepies.’ Jean-Luc Godard wrote an enthusiastic praise of Sirk’s sensibility, ‘a delirious mixture of medieval and modern,’ in Cahiers du Cinéma. Through an interview with Sirk in 1971, Jon Halliday consolidated the image of Sirk as an auteur who employed melodrama as a tool for social critique. Since the 1970s, feminist film critics have reread Sirk’s Hollywood melodramas as important sites where sexual norms were contested. Similarly grasping the political implications of Sirk’s melodrama, Rainer Werner Fassbinder directed Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (1974) which paid homage to Sirk’s All that Heaven Allows. Fassbinder’s remake transplanted the story from Sirk’s bucolic New England to urban Berlin, and translated the interclass romance into a cross-racial romance between an older German woman and a younger Arab man. Todd Haynes also paid a tribute to the film with Far from Heaven (2002).
