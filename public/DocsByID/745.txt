Novelist, poet, dramatist, and critic Stephen Gray was born in Cape Town and educated at the universities of Cape Town, Cambridge, and Iowa, where he was a member of the Iowa Writers Workshop. He edited Granta while at Cambridge and taught in France for some years before taking up a position at the Rand Afrikaans University (now the University of Johannesburg) in 1969, where he taught for some twenty years and became Professor of English. He took early retirement in 1991 and has since then worked as a freelance writer. The author of several works of poetry, drama, and fiction, Gray is also South Africa’s foremost anthologist and literary historiographer. 



Stephen Gray’s early novels are the satirical Local Colour (1975) and Invisible People (1977), and the historical Caltrop’s Desire (1980). His fascination with history is also reflected in John Ross: The True Story (1987), a fictionalized treatment of the life of Charles Maclean (‘John Ross’), a ship’s boy who survived a shipwreck off the Natal coast in 1825 and spent several years at the court of King Shaka. Later novels include Time of Our Darkness (1988), Born of Man (1989), and the semi-autobiographical War Child (1991). His autobiography, Accident of Birth, appeared in 1993.

An editor of the 1970s poetry journal Izwe, his own poetry is collected as It’s about Time (1974), The Assassination of Shaka (1974), with woodcuts by Cecil Skotnes, Hottentot Venus and Other Poems (1979), and Love Poems: Hate Poems (1982). Later collections are Apollo Café (1990) and Season of Violence (1992). His Selected Poems (1960–92) appeared in 1993 and was followed by the engaging and innovative Gabriel’s Exhibition (1998) and Shelley Cinema and Other Poems (2006). 



His work in drama includes the play script based on the prison experiences of Herman Charles Bosman, Cold Stone Jug: The Play (1982) (co-produced with Barney Simon), and the acclaimed Schreiner: A One-Woman Play (1983). He has made available the work of several out-of-print dramatists, from Stephen Black to Geraldine Aron, in collections such as Theatre One (1978), Theatre Two (1981) and Stephen Black: Three Plays (1984). 



As an anthologist he has produced many influential collections, including the very successful selection of southern African prose Writers’ Territory (1973; rev. ed. 1999), On the Edge of the World (1974), updated as Modern South African Stories (1980; revised edition 2002), The Penguin Book of Southern African Stories (1985), The Penguin Book of Contemporary South African Short Stories (1993), and The Picador Book of African Stories (2000). His own collection of short prose, Human Interest and Other Pieces (1993), includes ‘Letters to Pratt’, a piece about the would-be assassin of H. F. Verwoerd, David Pratt, which includes the text of letters sent to him by relatives and admirers. A later collection of stories is My Serial Killer and Other Stories (2005). His anthologies of South African poetry, which have been influential in shaping the canon, include A World of Their Own: Southern African Poets of the Seventies (1976), Modern South African Poetry (1984), and The Penguin Book of Southern African Verse (1989). 



His doctorate was published as Southern African Literature: An Introduction (1979), a highly influential series of historiographical essays on the formation of South African English literature. His more recent work includes a set of essays on important South African writers, Free-lancers and Literary Biography in South Africa (1999), and new editions of the works of Herman Charles Bosman and C.
