Ocampo, Galo (1913-1985) 



Galo Ocampo was a Filipino painter who is well known for his rejection of academic tradition and embrace of Western modernism. He also worked as a curator for the Presidential Museum at Malacañang Palace and was later appointed Director of the National Museum. Ocampo graduated from the School of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines and later taught at the University of Santo Tomas and Far Eastern University, where he led the Department of Fine Arts in 1971. His paintings typically show the influence of Cubism, Surrealism and Expressionism and their Christian themes include indigenous references. One of his most controversial works is The Brown Madonna (1938), which uses ethnic subjects in its play on Our Lady and Child imagery. Both figures are depicted with halos, and the work also includes Filipino references like bamboo trees and a bahay kubo (vernacular house). Ocampo’s hybrid mixing of styles and references can be seen in much contemporary art from the Philippines, albeit now more ironic. Other famous works by him include stained glass windows in the Sto. Domingo Church and Manila Cathedral, commissioned by the Archbishop of Manila in the 1960s. Ocampo was honored with a 1982 retrospective at the Museum of Philippine Art in Metro Manila.
