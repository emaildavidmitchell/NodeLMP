Doris Lessing (1919-2013) was one of the most diverse writers of the twentieth century, distinguishing herself for closely observed natural detail in The Grass in Singing, and for Formalism and Impressionism in early African stories such as ‘Sunrise on the Veld.’ She also excelled with a neo-gothic Frankenstein tale in The Fifth Child, with spiritual and psychological journeys in Briefing for a Descent into Hell and Memoirs of a Survivor, and by shifting into science or space fiction in The Canopus in Argos: Archives series. Few writers have experimented with as many genres and techniques, including the novel, stories, non-fiction, plays, poems, opera libretti, autobiography, and even a graphic novel. She was concerned with Communism, social criticism (The Sweetest Dream, The Golden Notebook), Sufism (Indries Shah), the psychology of R. D. Laing, mythology (Memoirs of a Survivor, Briefing for a Descent into Hell), archetypes, gender roles (The Golden Notebook, A Man and Two Women) fairy tales, global warming, and anti-colonialism evolving into Postcolonialism (Mara and Dann and General Dann). Because her sophisticated handling of irony, parody, and points of view is often misunderstood, Lessing has been mistakenly viewed as a traditional rather than a modernist writer, sometimes relying on stereotypical characterization in Martha Quest and The Cleft.

Doris Lessing (1919-2013) was one of the most diverse writers of the twentieth century, distinguishing herself for closely observed natural detail in The Grass in Singing, and for Formalism and Impressionism in early African stories such as ‘Sunrise on the Veld.’ She also excelled with a neo-gothic Frankenstein tale in The Fifth Child, with spiritual and psychological journeys in Briefing for a Descent into Hell and Memoirs of a Survivor, and by shifting into science or space fiction in The Canopus in Argos: Archives series. Few writers have experimented with as many genres and techniques, including the novel, stories, non-fiction, plays, poems, opera libretti, autobiography, and even a graphic novel. She was concerned with Communism, social criticism (The Sweetest Dream, The Golden Notebook), Sufism (Indries Shah), the psychology of R. D. Laing, mythology (Memoirs of a Survivor, Briefing for a Descent into Hell), archetypes, gender roles (The Golden Notebook, A Man and Two Women) fairy tales, global warming, and anti-colonialism evolving into Postcolonialism (Mara and Dann and General Dann). Because her sophisticated handling of irony, parody, and points of view is often misunderstood, Lessing has been mistakenly viewed as a traditional rather than a modernist writer, sometimes relying on stereotypical characterization in Martha Quest and The Cleft. Her masterpiece, The Golden Notebook, displaying the self-reflexiveness, antifiction, intertextuality, complex structure, parody, and irony associated with such international postmodernists as Samuel Beckett, Margaret Atwood, Angela Carter, John Fowles, Kurt Vonnegut, and Toni Morrison is now apparent as a postmodernist text which further develops Modernism. This metafictional work not only makes what the reader constructs as the main text into fictional works written by her characters, but opens the ending, as Du Plessis recognizes: she writes beyond the ending. Lessing died at her home in London on 17 November 2013.
