KLEIN, Melanie (March 30, 1882, Vienna  September 22, 1960, London)

Melanie Klein was a second-generation psychoanalyst who developed a play
technique for analyzing children and advanced object relations theory.
Klein was trained by Sndor Ferenczi and Karl Abraham, colleagues of
Sigmund Freud, in Budapest and Berlin, and became a leading figure in
psychoanalysis after moving to London in 1926.
Klein argues in works such as Love, Guilt and Reparation (1937) that
psychological development depends on the child's early adjustment to her
seemingly contradictory perceptions of the parent. The infant experiences
the mother as partial objects (including the nurturing and withheld
breast), which prompt feelings of love and aggression. The partial objects
and conflicting emotions coincide with a disjointed sense of self. During
normal development, the young child learns that the partial objects make up
the whole parent, the unified object of the child's emotions. Recognizing
the coexistence of good and bad in the parent, the child accepts her own
ambivalence, resulting in integration of the ego.
Klein trained D. W. Winnicott and John Bowlby, and has figured in the work
of Julia Kristeva, Judith Butler and Eve Sedgwick. Her focus on aggression
led to public disagreements with Anna Freud while her goal of ego-
integration provoked critique from Jacques Lacan.
