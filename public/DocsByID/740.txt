Gramatges [Leyte Vidal], Harold (1918-2008)
Mario Rey

Harold Gramatges was a leading composer, pianist, conductor, and educator
during the second half of the twentieth century in Cuba. He was a founding
member of the experimental music circle Grupo Renovaci(n Musical, and an
advocate of contemporary national expression based on the mastering of the
classic forms. His extensive catalogue reflects the synthesis of various
aesthetic tendencies with techniques of the musical avant-guard, and a
compositional style frequently characterized by dissonant, contrapuntal
procedures.  He made important contributions to the countrys music
education system.

Gramatges studied piano under Dulce Mar(a Serret (1898-1989) at the
Conservatorio Provincial de Oriente in Santiago, Cuba, and composition with
Amadeo Rold(n (1900-1939) and Jose Ard(vol (1911-1981) at the Conservatorio
Municipal de La Habana in Havana.  In 1942, the success of his Sonata para
clavich(mbalo, awards him a grant to study with Aaron Copeland (1900-1990)
and Serge Koussevitzky (1874-1951) at the Berkshire Music Center in
Tanglewood, Massachussetts. Returning to Havana later that year, he secured
a faculty position in the Conservatorio Municipal, where he served as
professor of composition, theory and music history until 1958. The period
between 1945 and 1957 is also marked by a series of concurrent conducting
appointments, including the conservatorys Orchesta Sinf(nica Juvenil,
which he established in 1945, the Orquesta de C(mara de La Habana, and the
Orquesta Sinf(nica de Radio CMQ.

His interests in developing new tendencies in Cuban art music establishes
Gramatges as a founding member of Grupo Renovaci(n Musical, an artistic
circle active between 1942-1948 that advocated an aesthetic more aligned
with modern European currents. Reacting to the overt nationalism prevailing
in Cuban concert music, he adopted a type of Hispanic Neoclassicism while
experimenting with all of the expressive resources of the mid-twentieth
century.  In 1943 his ballet (caro, commissioned by famed ballerina Alicia
Alonso (b. 1921), is premiered, and Gramatges is awarded the Reichold del
Caribe y (merica Central prize for his Sinfon(a en mi.

Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, Gramatges was appointed counselor
to the Departamento de M(sica de la Direcci(n General de Cultura del
Ministerio de Educaci(n, where he instituted a series of reforms in the
national music education system. Endeavouring to promote and disseminate
contemporary Cuban art music, he founded the Orquesta Sinf(nica Nacional,
and programmed concert series in which he generally performed as conductor
or pianist. From 1960-1964, he is appointed Ambassador to France.

In 1965 he established the music department at the cultural institution
Casa de las (mericas, which he directed until 1970, and became the chair
(and subsequently Professor Emeritus) of composition at the Instituto
Superior de Arte in 1976. He presided over the Asociaci(n de M(sicos de la
Uni(n de Escritores y Artistas de Cuba in 1993, and was named Honorary
Member of the Consejo Iberoamericano de la M(sica in the following year.

Gramatges prolific compositional output, catalogued at over 130 works,
encompasses vitually every genre, including symphonies, chamber and choral
pieces, film scores, art songs, and incidental music for theater. Within
this vast catalogue, his pianistic production is particularly noteworthy;
infused with driving rhythms and percussive technique, the compositions
make full idiomatic use of the instrument, and occupy a prominent place in
the national contemporary repertoire. While largely a neoclassicist, his
aesthetic ideas synthesized influences from traditional Cuban idioms,
chiefly from his native province of Oriente, with a contemporary harmonic
vocabulary, as exemplified by Dos danzas cubanas (1949) and Suite cubana
para ni(os (1956). In order to express a modernist national identity, his
works reveal daring extended harmonies, dissonant counterpoint,
polytonality, and techniques associated with the avant-guard movement such
as serialism and aleatory.

Gramatges has been conferred numerous national and international honorific
awards and composition prizes, such as the Premio Nacional de M(sica de
C(mara (1950), the Cuban state councils  Medalla de Alejo Carpentier
(1982), the Orden F(lix Varela (1988) conferred by the Ministry of Culture
for extraordinary contribution to the arts, and the Premio Nacional de
M(sica (2002). In 1996 he was the first recipient of the Premio
Iberoamericano de la M(sica Tom(s Luis de Victoria (1548-1611), further
positioning him as a leading figure in Cuban and Latin American art music.
