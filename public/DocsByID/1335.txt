Edvard Munch (1863 Lten, Norway 1944, Ekely/Oslo)
was a Norwegian painter, printmaker and sculptor, who experimented with
photography and film. He belongs to the main forerunners of EXPRESSIONISM
and his painting The Scream (1893) became a universal icon of
existentialist fear.
Career
In 1879 Munch enrolled at a technical college and in 1881 at the Royal
School of Art and Design of Christiania, where he took lessons in freehand
drawing and modelling. In 1882 he was supervised by the naturalistic
painter Christian Krohg and in 1883 he held his first public exhibition. In
1885 Munch travelled to Paris; some influences of French art were
recognizable in the works he presented at his first one-man show in
Christiania in 1889. The recognition he received with this exhibition
gained him a state scholarship to Paris for the period 1889-92. There he
studied under French painter Lon Bonnat and saw works by Paul Gauguin,
Vincent van Gogh, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec and James Whistler. (Post-
)IMPRESSIONISM and synthetism influenced his work of this period.
In 1889 Munch painted a portrait of Hans Jger, leader of the Christiania
Bohme and since then he belonged to its wider circle. In his symbolic
paintings and literary diaries he followed the dictum of this anarchist
writer You should write your life. Traumatic memories of illness and
death became the leitmotif of his painting, which is reflected e.g. in his
first experimental masterpiece The Sick Child (1886). His soul paintings
corresponded with the theory of the naked soul by Stanisaw
Przybyszewski, who became his first monographer in 1893. Munch met him,
August Strindberg and Hendrik Ibsen in Berlin after his first exhibition
there in 1892, which caused the Munch scandal. In contrast to the
predominant negative criticism, Przybyszewski prised his Frieze of Life
(including e.g. The Kiss and Vampire). Referring to the Frieze, he invented
the first theory of proto-expressionism and contributed to Munchs success
in Central Europe.
In 1894 Munch started experimenting with etching, lithography and woodcut,
becoming a master of these reproductive techniques; he tended to
concentrate on the repetition of existential themes. After he settled in
Paris in 1896 graphic depictions of modern popular culture became his main
focus. At the turn of the century, he combined in his paintings
metaphysical ideas with a symbolical usage of colour and composition.
With his 1902 show at the Berliner Secession and his 1905 one-man
exhibition in Prague organized by the Mnes Union of Fine Arts, Munch
gradually became an established painter with patrons and dealers in
Germany, e.g. Max Linde, Bruno Cassirer, Eberhard von Bodenhausen and Harry
Graf Kessler. He painted portraits of his supporters and of well-known
contemporaries such as Friedrich Nietzsche (1905/06 the only one painted
from photographs). In 1906 he designed the sets for Max Reinhardts
theatre. His new themes were Bathing Men (1907-08) and from 1916 on as he
mostly lived in isolation in Ekely near Oslo nature, nudes and numerous
self-portraits.
Legacy
In 1908 when Munch stayed at a clinic in Copenhagen because of a nervous
breakdown after years of personal and artistic struggle, he was awarded the
Royal Order of St.Olav for services in art. In 1909 he returned to
Norway where he showed three hundred of his works in a retrospective
exhibition. He won the competition for the monumental decorations of the
Aula of the Christiania/Oslo University, which he completed in 1916. His
first American exhibition was held in New York in 1912. Munchs most
important exhibitions were shown in Germany  the Sonderbund in Cologne in
1912 and a comprehensive show at the Nationalgalerie in Berlin in 1927. In
1937 his works were denounced as degenerate art and removed from German
museums. Munch left the majority of his works to the city of Oslo, which
opened a museum in his honour in 1963.
