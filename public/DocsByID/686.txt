Constance Garnett was an English translator of Russian literature, and the first to translate Anton Chekov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky into English. 



Garnett was born in Brighton in 1861 to David Black (1817–1892), a solicitor, town clerk, and coroner, and Clara Maria Patten (1825–1875), the daughter of George Patten (1801–1865), portrait painter to Prince Albert. Her siblings included the mathematician Arthur Black (1851–1893) and the novelist and trade union activist Clementina Black (1853–1922).



Garnett married Edward Garnett (1835–1906), a literary critic and editor, in 1889. Their son David Garnett (1892–1981) was a novelist and member of the Bloomsbury Group.



Garnett won a scholarship to study at Newnham College, Cambridge, and was one of the first women to graduate from that college. Between the 1890s and the 1930s, Garnett translated over 70 works of Russian literature, including works by Alexander Ostrovsky, Ivan Goncharov, Nikolai Gogol, Dostoyevsky, Alexander Herzen, and Anton Chekhov. She translated Leo Tolstoy’s major works and the complete works of Ivan Turgenev. 



Although criticized by Vladimir Nabokov, among others, for imposing her own narrative voice on her translations, her work was instrumental in making Russian literature accessible to English-speaking readers, and is still considered authoritative.



Garnett died in Kent in 1946.
