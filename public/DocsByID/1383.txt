      Book by Henry Cowell (b. 1897 Menlo Park, California; d. 1965 Shady,
New York) written in 1919 but unpublished until 1930. Cowell proposes a
theory of musical relativity in which pitch, rhythm, and the progress
of music history are grounded through reference to the structure of the
overtone series, the living essence from which musicality springs. The
text was written when ethnomusicologist Charles Seeger encouraged the young
Cowell to rationalize the compositional tools he had been developing.
      In the books first section, Cowell presents the development of
western harmony as progressive upward movement through the overtone series.
He suggests the continuation of this same logic into chords based on the
ratios beyond the minor seconds he was using to create cluster chords.
His rhythm chapter proposes the whole-note as the basic unit of time,
encouraging division beyond the standard multiples of two into the next
numbers in the harmonic series creating third-notes, fifth notes, etc. This
method enables the composition of rhythmic patterns that rely on the same
ratios as are present between various melodic and harmonic intervals. Many
American composers  notably Conlon Nancarrow  have utilized Cowells
concepts, which predate by several decades the development of similar ideas
in integral serialism.
