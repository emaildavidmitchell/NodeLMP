Katarzyna Kobro (1898 Moscow  1951 d)
was artist of German-Russian origin, active in Russia, Latvia, but mainly
based in Poland. An outstanding sculptor and art theoretician, painter,
graphic artist, stage, fashion and architecture designer, Kobro is one of
the most distinguished sculptors and female artists of the 20th century and
a main representative of POLISH CONSTRUCTIVISM and INTERNATIONAL
CONSTRUCTIVISM.
Career
Kobro studied at the Moscow School of Art, Sculpture and Architecture
(1917) and the Free Art Workshops (SVOMAS, 1918-20). In 1918 she joined the
radical leftist Trade Union of Painters of the City of Moscow. In 1920 she
was a lecturer of sculpture at the school of ceramics in Smolesk, where
she moved together with Wadysaw Strzemiski, her partner in life and art.
In 1921 she co-organized with Strzemiski the Smolesk branch of the UNOWIS
group, collaborating with its Vitebsk branch, which was organized by
Kazimir Malevich and El Lissitzky.
A member and co-founder of the Polish constructivist groups Blok (1924-25),
Praesens (1926-28) and a.r. (1929-36), Kobro participated in their
exhibitions and other important shows in Poland, among them The Modernists
Salon at the Warsaw Trade Union of Artists (1928) and the Institute for the
Propaganda of Art (1933).
In her theoretical statements on post-suprematism, constructivism and
functionalism in the magazines Europa (2/1929), Forma (4/1936) and Gos
Plastykw (Visual Artists Voice, 1-7/1937), she promoted non-
individualised sculpture as a sequence of subsequent shapes in space which
produces a spatio-temporal rhythm and, like Strzemiski, refused to accept
a separation between fine and applied arts. Together with Strzemiski, she
published the theory of unism in the book Spacial Composition: Calculation
of Spatio-Temporal Rhythm in 1931 and founded the International Collection
of Modern Art in the City Museum of History and Art in d.
In 1932 Kobro joined Abstraction-Cration and was also invited to
Internationaler Ring der neuen Werbegestalter. In 1933 she became a member
of the Forma editorial staff, a vice-member of the board and, from 1935 on,
she served as treasurer of the Trade Union of Polish Artists in d. In
1937 she signed the Dimensionist Manifesto published by Hans Arp, Marcel
Duchamp and Lszl Moholy-Nagy.
Kobros early sculptures, known from photographs and reconstructions: Tos
75  Structure (1920) and two Hanging Constructions (c. 1921-22), were
assemblages of metal elements, wood, glass and cork, partly achieving
kinetic effects. In her Abstract Compositions (1924-26), the architectural
projects (Tobacco Cabin, 1927-28, Functional Kindergarten, 1932-34) and
Spatial Compositions (1931-1933), the sculpture is an open form that
penetrates and absorbs space into itself and integrates it into the
surrounding environment. In Abstract Sculptures she respected the natural
colour of materials, sometimes adding black and white, while in the Spatial
Compositions she used colours typical of the design created by De Stijl
artists  yellow, red, blue, black and white.
In her original concept and practice of unism, the arithmetical principles
of art were derived from the golden section and forms followed the organic
order of nature. Biological qualities found a special depiction in her
Nudes (1933-35) and Seascape (1936/37). Her Nudes from 1931-33 are even
figurative classical ones.
Legacy
Kobros work has been internationally rediscovered, first with the revision
of constructivism as a tradition of conceptualism and minimal art in the
1960s and then with feminist interpretations and exhibitions of works by
female artists. Her artistic rank in the field of sculpture and avant-garde
art theory has been honoured by the establishment of the Katarzyna Kobro
Award, which since 2001 has been given annually to especially innovative
artists, who inspire cultural exchange.
