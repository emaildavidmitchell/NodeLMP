Pentland, Barbara Lally (1912-2000)

Janet Danielson



	Barbara Pentland was arguably the most rigorously modernist Canadian composer of her generation. During the late 1940s she adopted serial techniques and by the mid-1950s had forged her mature style: spare, elegantly constructed, abstract, yet with a rich timbral palette and surprising lyricism. She made adept use of new techniques throughout her career. She taught at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto (1942-1949); then at the University of British Columbia (1949-1963). She received a Diplôme d’honneur from the Canadian Conference for the Arts (1977); honorary doctorates from the University of Manitoba (1976) and Simon Fraser University (1985); the Order of Canada (1989); and the Order of British Columbia (1993). Situated within the confluence of early women’s rights struggles and Canada’s search for identity at the official end of colonial rule in 1931, Pentland’s musical modernism lent authenticity and authority to her artistic voice: her music sounded neither British nor stereotypically feminine. As one reviewer observed, Pentland’s music had “that cool remoteness which conjures wide-open spaces and is probably as close to a national sound as anything Canadian composers have achieved.”



	Barbara Pentland was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to a well-off family whose ambition to make a socialite of their daughter was persistently thwarted by her interest in music and in the life of the mind. Undaunted by parental opposition and the bleak prospects of the Great Depression, Pentland acquired an education rivaling that of any of her Canadian peers. In Paris in 1929, ostensibly attending finishing school, she studied with composer Cécile Gauthiez, receiving a thorough grounding in harmony, analysis, and counterpoint, and strong encouragement to compose: “You have the flame, you must go on.” Once back in Winnipeg, Pentland used her dress allowance to pay Gauthiez for correspondence lessons.

	Pentland won a fellowship to Juilliard in 1936, earning her degree in three years. Unable to secure a position in New York or Montreal, she returned to Winnipeg, producing music for a radio drama, Payload, and a children’s ballet, Beauty and the Beast. On the strength of Beauty and the Beast and Little Symphony for Full Orchestra (1940), she became the first woman composer to attend Tanglewood, where she studied with Aaron Copland.

	Pentland met Harry Adaskin and John Weinzweig on a 1941 visit to Toronto, and subsequently moved there on Weinzweig’s encouragement, barely supporting herself teaching at the Royal Conservatory of Music. Her Studies in Line (1941) for piano were performed in New York in 1942. Reflecting the burgeoning national interest in Canadian music, the CBC International Service presented a broadcast on Pentland in 1946, including Studies in Line, Song Cycle, and Sonata for Cello and Piano. Pentland met composer and recent Schoenberg student Dika Newlin (1923-2006) at the MacDowell Colony in the summers of 1947 and 1948. Together they studied Newlin’s collection of Schoenberg and Webern scores as well as René Leibowitz’s overblown manifesto of musical modernism, Schoenberg and His School. Pentland appreciated the organizational potential of serial technique and employed it in her 1948 Wind Quintet.

	In 1949 Harry Adaskin, now head of the University of British Columbia Music Department, offered Pentland a teaching post, citing her reputation as a proponent of modernism. In 1950 she participated in “An Investigation into Modernism in the Arts,” a symposium hosted by CBC Toronto, and wrote an article in Northern Review outlining her artistic concerns: “Our American contemporaries have the music of Copland, Piston and many others which they can respect […] We have had no such important innovators to make our expression unfold from the material around us.” For Pentland, the innovative efforts of pioneering composers were essential both to the development of a distinctively Canadian form of musical expression and to the natural evolution of culture. Pentland’s chamber opera, The Lake (1953, libretto by Dorothy Livesay), treats of these themes through the conceit of pioneer/colonist Susan Allison, who aimed to “nurture the land from wilderness.” Pentland, like Allison, decried patriarchy—while excepting Schoenberg, Bartok, Stravinsky, and Hindemith, whose work constituted music’s “natural heritage.” Pentland’s exposure to postwar serialism at Darmstadt’s 1955 New Music Course helped solidify her mature style. A BBC broadcast of her piano works in 1955 and a performance of her organ concerto in Westminster Abbey in 1957 attestted to her growing international acclaim. String Quartet No. 2 (1953) was the first Canadian work ever to be selected for performance at an International Society of Contemporary Music Festival. This coup was marred by an evident betrayal: the Canadian League of Composers withdrew its ISCM membership by telegram during the 1956 Festival, leaving Pentland, as League delegate, stranded in Stockholm.

	Pentland’s first large work in her mature style, Symphony in Ten Parts (1956), was composed during a 1957-1958 European sojourn. She returned to a music department with new head, an increasingly American faculty, and, to Pentland’s consternation, no counterpoint requirement for composition students. Pentland was now getting numerous commissions, including one from the Winnipeg Symphony for Symphony No. 4 (1960), which occasioned a triumphal return to her hometown. Her growing success, her 1958 marriage to John Huberman, and a recent inheritance enabled Pentland to resign the contentious UBC post in 1963 in order to compose full-time. 

	Canada’s 1967 Centennial brought her three important commissions: Trio con Alea, incorporating aleatoric zones; Septet; and her large Suite Borealis for piano. The anti-war movement inspired Pentland’s News (1970) for soprano, prepared tape, and orchestra. After 1970, Pentland focused on chamber, piano, and vocal works such as Interplay (1972) for accordion and string quartet; a brass quintet, Occasions (1974); a song-cycle of Dorothy Livesay’s poetry, Disasters of the Sun (1976) for mezzo-soprano, nine instruments, and prepared tape—Pentland’s longest work; and Éventa (1978) for large ensemble and harp. 

	The 1980s were the last decade of Pentland’s composing life. She explored environmental themes in Tellus (1982) for mixed quartet and in Ice Age (1986) for voice and piano. After Canticum, Burlesca and Finale (1987) for piano, her productivity was hampered both by health problems and by disillusionment: the modernistic style Pentland had cultivated with such imagination, sophistication, and exquisite musicality had not supplanted the diatonic tonality which modernism had relegated to the past.
