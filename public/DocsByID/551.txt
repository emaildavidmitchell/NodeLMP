Inji Efflatoun is an Egyptian painter, feminist and political activist. She
received her secondary education at the Lyce Franais in Cairo where she
was introduced to Marxism. At the beginning of the 1940s, she was one of
the first women to attend the Faculty of Arts at Cairo University and she
joined the Egyptian Communist organization (Iskra). During that time, she
studied under the painter and filmmaker Kamel el-Tilmisani and exhibited
with the Egyptian Surrealist Group Art and Liberty (1942-1943). She later
studied in the studio of the Swiss artist Margo Veillon and with the
painter Hamed Abdalla. In 1959, her political activities resulted in her
being arrested. She was imprisoned for four and a half years and painted
throughout her incarceration until she was released in 1963. Efflatouns
paintings are strongly inspired by the social reality of the Egyptian
working class, with a special focus on women and their daily struggle.
