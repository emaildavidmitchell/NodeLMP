Georg Heym was one of the leading poets of the early expressionist movement in Berlin. The introduction to Van Hoddis’ and Hiller’s Der Neue Club (The New Club) and his reading performances in Das neopathetische Kabarett (The Neo-Pathetic Cabaret) meant his breakthrough as a poet. It led to a collection of poems entitled Der ewige Tag (The Eternal Day, 1911), the first and only publication during his lifetime. Inspired by the visionary metaphorical language of Hölderlin, Verlaine, Baudelaire, Rimbaud and others, Heym developed a poetic vocabulary with poignant simultaneous images of death and destruction, of outcasts and of the metropolis as a ‘demon’.

Typical of Heym’s style is the repudiation of the lyrical I, which is sometimes replaced by a universal but impersonal ‘We’. Technology, media, industry and other aspects of modern capitalist society are the source of Heym’s uncanny mythological landscapes, evoking a ghostly, netherworldly atmosphere which ominously prefigures the battle fields of World War I. Heym died while sledding; he drowned as he tried to save a friend who had fallen through the ice. He was 24 years old. Posthumously, his friend published Umbra Vitae (1912), Heym’s most renowned collection of poems.
