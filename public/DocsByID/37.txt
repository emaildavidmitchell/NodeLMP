Darat al Funun (A Home for the Arts)



Founded in 1993 by husband and wife Khalid and Suha Shoman, Darat al Funun
represents a pioneering initiative for the visual arts in Jordans private
sector. Neither a museum nor a gallery, Darat al Funun was founded as a
home for the arts, dedicated to research, creativity, and exchange. Housed
in five historic buildings in the heart of the capital of Amman, Darat al
Funun hosts artists residencies, workshops, exhibition galleries, lecture
halls, a library, caf, dissertation fellowship program, and extensive
programming. Equally dedicated to research and practice, artists and their
audiences, Darat al Funun serves as a meeting point for artists from the
region and abroad and provides an infrastructure for a complete trajectory
of artistic creation. Darat al Funun is also home to the Khalid Shoman
Collection. Begun in the early eighties, the collection represents one of
the earliest dedicated exclusively to contemporary art of the Arab world
and its diasporas.
