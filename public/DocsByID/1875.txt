STILL, CLYFFORD (1904–1980) 				Word Count: 214

						

Clyfford Still belonged to the first generation of Abstract Expressionist painters. His immense canvases featuring interlocking patches of uniform colour influenced his peers, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. Still created his signature scabrous surfaces by applying paint with a palette knife. The resulting craggy forms evoke the landscape of the American West. Still was born in Grandin, North Dakota, and raised in Spokane, Washington and Bow Island in Alberta, Canada. In the 1930s, he studied and taught in Pullman, Washington at Washington State College, where he produced expressionist paintings of toiling labourers. He increasingly simplified and flattened these tormented figures before arriving at his fully abstract canvases of the early 1940s. Though he exhibited his paintings in New York in the 1940s, he spent the decade teaching at the Richmond Professional Institute in Virginia, and the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. Still relocated to New York in 1950 at the height of the Abstract Expressionist movement. In 1961, he moved to rural Maryland, where he spent the remainder of his life. His paintings of 1960s and 1970s incorporate large areas of empty canvas.
