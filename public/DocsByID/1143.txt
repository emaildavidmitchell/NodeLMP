Dorothy Livesay was a Canadian poet, journalist, activist, social worker, instructor, field worker, and author of short fiction, literary criticism, radio plays, and autobiography. Her collection of poetry Day and Night (1944) was lauded as a significant socialist, modernist text.



Livesay was born on October 12, 1909 in Winnipeg, Manitoba to journalist parents. She received a B.A., Honours in modern languages (1931) from the University of Toronto. Influenced by IMAGISM, she published her first collection of poetry Green Pitcher (1928), a well-received book of lyric poetry, while still an undergraduate student. Livesay studied at the Sorbonne, earning a Diplôme D’Études Supérieures (1932). Her thesis was entitled ‘Symbolism and the Metaphysical Tradition in Modern English Poetry.’ In Paris, she was exposed to Marxism and the effects of the Depression in Europe and developed her left-wing politics in response. Upon returning to Canada in 1932, she published a second book of poetry, Signpost, enrolled in the School of Social Work at U of T, and joined the Young Communist League.

Influenced by IMAGISM, she published her first collection of poetry Green Pitcher (1928), a well-received book of lyric poetry, while still an undergraduate student.

Upon returning to Canada in 1932, she published a second book of poetry, Signpost, enrolled in the School of Social Work at U of T, and joined the Young Communist League. 



While working as a caseworker in Montreal, New Jersey, and Vancouver, she published poetry, fiction and articles for the socialist Little Magazines New Frontier and Masses and eventually became the western editor for New Frontier upon her move to Vancouver in 1936. In Vancouver, Livesay worked as a caseworker, opened a community centre, married Duncan MacNair, and became an editor for Alan Crawley’s West-Coast literary journal, Contemporary Verse. 	



During the 1940s, Livesay grew disillusioned with communism but retained strong political convictions, writing about labour issues and broaching feminist topics, such as social roles and sexuality. Her collection of poetry Day and Night (1944) won the Governor-General’s Award for Poetry and established Livesay’s reputation as a socialist poet. In 1946, Livesay travelled to Europe to work as a post-war correspondent for the Toronto Daily Star. The following year she published Poems for People (1947)—which garnered the Governor-General’s Award for Poetry—and was awarded the Lorne Pierce Medal by the Royal Society of Canada for her contribution to Canadian literature. Continuing her commitment to political poetry, Livesay composed Call My People Home (1950), a documentary poem for radio about the Canadian government’s internment of Japanese families in B.C. during the Second World War. 



Following her husband’s death in 1958, Livesay taught in Zambia (1960-1963). She earned a M.Ed. (1966) from the University of British Columbia and held teaching and writer-in-residence positions at U.B.C., University of New Brunswick, University of Alberta, University of Victoria, University of Manitoba, and Simon Fraser University. 



As Livesay approached old age, she commenced writing autobiographical prose—notably, A Winnipeg Childhood (1973), and Right Hand Left Hand (1977), an account of her political life in the 1930s. In 1975, Livesay launched the literary magazine Contemporary Verse 2. Livesay received numerous honours for her poetic and activist achievements, including the Order of Canada in 1987. She died in Victoria on December 19, 1996. Livesay’s extensive body of work contributed a strong socialist and feminist voice to twentieth-century Canadian literature.
