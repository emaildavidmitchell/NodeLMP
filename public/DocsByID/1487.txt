Erwin Panofsky was a German-American art historian who from 1926 to 1933 worked alongside Ernst Cassirer (1874-1945) at the University of Hamburg and at the Bibliothek Warburg. From the outset, he was critical of approaches (such as Heinrich Wöfflin’s [1964-1945]) that divorced form from content.  Panofsky first outlined his historically and socially based iconological approach to the analysis of an art work in Hercules am Scheidewege und andere antike Bildstoffe in der neuen Kunst (1930), and elaborated it in a more systematic form in Studies in Iconology (1939).

From the outset, he was critical of approaches (such as Heinrich Wöfflin’s [1964-1945]) that divorced form from content.  Panofsky first outlined his historically and socially based iconological approach to the analysis of an art work in Hercules am Scheidewege und andere antike Bildstoffe in der neuen Kunst (1930), and elaborated it in a more systematic form in Studies in Iconology (1939). Panofsky’s approach distinguished three levels of reading an image: the ‘pre-iconographic’, which is the level of  ‘natural meanings. . . or artistic motifs’;  the iconographic, which involves understanding the image through stories and conventions; and the iconological, which ‘conceives of these pure forms, motifs, images, stories and allegories as manifesting underlying principles, . . . [interpreting] these elements as what Ernst Cassirer has called ‘symbolical’ values’ (Panofsky 1955, 40-41). Panofsky’s interests were wide-ranging and he published several important works on subjects other than art history: he wrote illuminatingly about Mozart and published reflections on the detective novel.  His ‘Style and Medium in the Motion Pictures’ (1934) is a central text in early film theory.
