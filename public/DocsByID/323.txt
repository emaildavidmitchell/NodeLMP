Capra, Frank (1897-1991)

Murat Akser (University of Ulster, UK)

Frank Capra was born to an Italian family in Palermo, Italy, and  raised  in
Los Angeles. With  films  characterized  by  nimble  narratives,  idealistic
characters, and happy  endings,  he  became  one  of  the  most  influential
Hollywood directors of the 1930s and 1940s, and  one  of  the  first  to  be
acknowledged as an auteur by subsequent generations  of  critics.  His  name
was written above the title of his films, a circumstance  that  signals  his
status as a star director. He later titled his autobiography The Name  above
the Title.

His romantic comedy It Happened One Night, with Clark  Gable  and  Claudette
Colbert,  earned  five  Academy  Award  nominations  and  is  credited  with
changing the way Americans looked at both fashion and relationships  in  the
cinema. The film tells the story of a bus  ride  from  Miami  to  New  York.
Claudette Colbert plays a runaway heiress who falls in love with  a  middle-
class news reporter. The film  sought  to  encourage  audiences  during  the
Great Depression. In  the  end,  the  passengers  of  a  bus  start  singing
together, thereby inventing a  fleeting  moment  of  hope  where  they  can
forget their problems and become united as community (Levy 2005).

Capras  protagonists  are  usually  nave   Americans   surviving   against
impossible odds in the face of  corrupt  politics  and  business  practices;
they were most emblematically  incarnated  by  his  main  male  leads,  Gary
Cooper and James Stewart. Both play innocent, nave characters who  win  out
against  much   stronger   antagonists   after   experiencing   considerable
suffering, in such titles as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Mr.  Smith  Goes
to Washington (1939), Meet John  Doe  (1941),  and  Its  a  Wonderful  Life
(1946). Lost Horizon (1937) is a fantasy film  that  influenced  generations
of filmmakers, including Steven Spielberg. Capras  films  tell  stories  of
hope and of the survival of idealism in an essentially cruel world.

During World War Two, Capra directed a series of  documentaries  to  support
the American war effort. Called Why We Fight, the series had lasting  impact
on documentary film  style.  He  founded  the  independent  studio  Republic
Pictures to produce Its a Wonderful Life  now considered  his  masterpiece
 but this ended in financial disaster. The company went bankrupt and  Capra
was seen as a liability by the studios. In addition, during the  late  1940s
and 1950s, Capra  was  also  disillusioned  with  the  HUAC  witch-hunts  in
Hollywood.

Capras last years were devoted to making educational and industrial  films.
From 1952 to 1956, Capra made four science-related  television  specials  in
color: Our Mr. Sun (1956), Hemo the Magnificent (1957), The Strange Case  of
the Cosmic Rays (1957), and Meteora: The  Unchained  Goddess  (1958).  Capra
also made industrial and scientific documentaries on  space:  Rendezvous  in
Space (1964), his last film, was shown at the 1964  New  York  World's  Fair
and was screened at the New York Hall of Science after the Fair ended.
