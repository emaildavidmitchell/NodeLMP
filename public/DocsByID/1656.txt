ROHMER, ric (b. 21 March 1920, Tulle, Corrze, France; d.11 January 2010,
Paris, France).

ric Rohmer (born Jean-Marie-Maurice Scher) was  a  French  film  director,
screenwriter and film critic,  best  known  for  his  association  with  the
French New Wave, his sophisticated  films  exploring  the  intersections  of
romantic desire and moral choice.. A student  of  literature,  theology  and
philosophy with a degree in history, Rohmer started as a teacher,  but  soon
gravitated, like many future New Wave  directors,  towards  Henri  Langlois
Cinmatheque Franaise and he also began writing for Cahiers  du  Cinma  in
1951. He was the editor of Cahiers du Cinma from 19571963.

Rohmer made mostly shorts in the early 1950s, but his  career  commenced  in
earnest in 1963 when he began work on Six Moral Tales -  a  cycle  of  films
examining the complicated entanglements  of  moral  and  desire.  Each  film
centers on a romantic  triangle  and  is  mainly  concerned  with  the  ways
characters internalize and think about erotic satisfaction rather  than  act
on it. The best known of the six films are Ma Nuit Chez Maud  (My  Night  at
Maud, 1969), in which a Catholic engineer resists the seduction attempts  of
a divorce, and Le Genou de Claire (Claires Knee, 1970),  the  story  of  a
diplomat who finds himself smitten with the knee of a young girl;  he  later
sublimates this desire into an ambiguous act of compassion.
At heart, Rohmer is a moraliste  -  a  student  of  human  character  and  a
philosopher of moral choice, in the manner of La Bruyre,  La  Rochefoucauld
or Pascal. His films tend to be static and  conversation  heavy,  and  their
considerable charm comes from the sophisticated wit of their  dialogues.  He
saw cinema  as  more  akin  to  novels,  in  its  capacity  to  explore  the
characters psychologies, without negating its essential visuality:  in  his
1955 article The Celluloid and the Marble he describes film  as  the  only
truly expressive and poetic art of the 20th century; such a statement  would
align him, somewhat surprisingly, with  the  modernist  avant-garde  of  the
1920s and 30s. Although he worked with established actors from time to  time
(most  notably  Jean-Louis  Trintignant),  Rohmer  preferred  to  cast  non-
professionals in his films.
Rohmers filmography is varied and lengthy, and includes many adaptations,
most notably, 1976s Die Marquise von O (The Marquise of O) based on a
novella by Kleist, and 1978s Perceval la Gallois [Perceval], a colorful,
bejeweled take on Chrtien de Troyes 12th-century romance in which he
sought to emulate the style of medieval illuminated manuscripts. In the
early 1980s he started work on another series of six films titled Comedies
and Proverbs, followed in the 1990s by the four films that make up Tales of
the Four Seasons. In 2000 he directed L'anglaise et le duc (The Lady and
the Duke) ,a period piece set during the French Revolution,  notable by its
innovative visuals which placed the characters against elaborately painted
backdrops of 18th-century France. His last film, The Romance of Astre and
Celadon [Romance of Astree and Celadon],  based on a 17th-century romance
was released in 2007.
