CRAIG, EDWARD GORDON (1872-1966)


Edward Gordon Craig was one of the leading figures of modernist theatre.
His books, stage designs, manifestos, and collaborations all contributed to
an understanding of performance as an autonomous aesthetic activity, as a
creative event that does not rely soley on the multifaceted transpositions
of the literary text, but offers a unique, synaesthetic possibility of
combining different art forms. Craigs work was crucial in  conceiving of
performance as a live, ephemeral but dynamic event that may derive from a
literary text but is never confined to it.

The son of actress Ellen Terry and architect E. W. Godwin, Craigs early
life in England was steeped in theatre. The seeds of his craft and radical
thinking were sown  during his apprenticeship with his mother and Sir Henry
Irving at Londons Lyceum Theatre, while his early productions of the
1890sPurcells Dido and Aeneas and the semi-operatic Masque of Love and
Handels Acis and Galateawere influenced by his composer friend Martin
Shaw. During the same period and in the spirit of the Arts and Crafts
movement, Craig edited a short-lived magazine called The Page (1899) and
produced a number of books, all of which experimented with the relationship
between text and image but also with the ways the printed page itself could
act as a type of stage. These early projects that brought together theatre,
opera, and the printed page highlighted his synaesthetic
approachinfluenced by Wagners notion of the Gesamtkunstwerkan approach
that was to be the hallmark of his later experiments in modernist theatre.

Craigs work can be read as enacting and bridging the crucial shift between
the Arts and Crafts movement and modernism, while also creating links
between the Anglophone stage traditions of the actor-manager and the
continental theatrical experiments that helped shape modernist performance,
particularly in the areas of modernist acting and directing. Indeed,
Craigs life itself can be seen as having enacted such a trajectory. He
left England for Germany in 1904 and in 1905 produced one of his most
influential books, The Art of the Theatre. In 1908 he settled in Florence
at the Arena Goldoni and published The Mask (1908-1929), one of first
journals to be devoted to theatre as a performance practice. Throughout the
many volumes of The Mask, Craig explicated his radical ideas, his deep
understanding of theatre history, and his own projects. His notorius essay
The Actor and the bermarionette, a re-working of and homage to Heinrich
von Kleists essay on puppets of c.1810, appeared in The Mask in 1909, and
one of his most significant collaborations with Konstantin Stanislavsky, on
the Moscow Hamlet (1908-1911), is chronicled in journals pages, utilising
many of the sixty-five pseudonyms that Craig created for himself.

Craigs ideas on acting, on the use of screens to conceptualise scenic
space, and on lighting and costume took shape through his sometimes
difficult collaborations with leading modernist figures like Stanislavsky
at the Moscow Art Theatre, dancer Isadora Duncan, and W. B. Yeats at the
Abbey Theatre. Although he mounted few productions after the age of about
forty, his early bookswritten with the fervour of the modernist manifesto
combined sometimes with philosophical, Platonic dialogueand his numerous
publications of stage designs helped to create and solidify a language for
modernist performance that continues to inspire theatre makers and
performance theorists today.
