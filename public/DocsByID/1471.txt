Oz began publishing his first short stories as a young man in Kibbutz Hulda in the 1960s. His breakthrough as an author came with the publication of his second novel, Mikhael sheli (My Michael, 1968), about an agitated young wife and mother in Mandatory Jerusalem. Oz was hailed as part of a new generation of native-born Israeli authors because of his subject matter, his literary style, and his Hebrew. He names as his greatest literary influences Sherwood Anderson, William Faulkner, Anton Chekhov, Lev Tolstoy, and earlier Hebrew authors such as Michah Yosef Berdichevsky, Yosef Hayim Brenner, Gnessin, and S. Y. Agnon. 

The themes that typify Oz's early writings concern a typically modernist preoccupation with a fragmented, discordant world. Particularly in his depictions of the kibbutz and its characters, Oz expressed the disintegration of a Zionist ideology imagined to have been harmonious and whole before it succumbed to human failings. In earlier works, Oz's Hebrew was denser and more multi-layered than that of his later works, for two reasons: the first is the influence of Agnon, an author known for the multifaceted and labyrinthine nature of his intensely allusive Hebrew; the second is that, as a young author, Oz was writing in a relatively new state using a Hebrew into which he was born, a circumstance that brought with it certain responsibilities. Unlike many of his Hebrew literary precursors, Oz's language was now formally linked to an existing national identity rather than to one that was aspirational, cultural, or religious in nature. 

He produced some of his most acclaimed novels in the 1980s, including Menuha nekhona (A Perfect Peace, 1982) and Kufsa shehora (Black Box, 1987). Some of his novels from the end of that decade and the 1990s, such as Ladaat isha (To Know a Woman, 1989) and Al tagidi laila (Don't Call It Night, 1994), focused more on individuals leading quiet, mundane private lives, disappointing readers and critics who were accustomed to the more colourful and sweeping scope of his previous novels. His monumental Sipur al ahava ve-hoshekh (A Tale of Love and Darkness, 2002), a literary autobiography that presents Oz's life as intimately intertwined with the dramatic history of the State of Israel, restored him to the pinnacle of the Israeli literary pantheon and is considered to be one of the most important Hebrew works of the past century. 

Many younger Israeli authors rebel against Oz's stylistic and thematic legacy, which they consider outdated and pass√©, in favour of writing that is either postmodern or more explicitly politically motivated. Nevertheless, Oz remains the most formidable and best-known Hebrew author in the world.
