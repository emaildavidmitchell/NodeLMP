Enani, Salah (b. 1955, Egypt)



Salah Enani is most known for his painted compositions depicting playfully rendered figures with exaggerated caricatured features. His works often present readily recognised Egyptian cultural figures like Umm Kulthum and Naguib Mahfouz. Salah Enani was trained at the Faculty of Art Education in Cairo and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 1977. Early in his career, Enani worked as a commercial illustrator, which significantly influenced his painting style. After shifting to working as a painter, Salah Enani served as an instructor at the Faculty of Arts Education at Helwan University in Cairo. As an artist, Enani represented Egypt at the 1986 Netenberg Drawing Biennale in Germany as well as the Egyptian Cultural Week held in Sharjah in 2000. His work is included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Egyptian Modern Art in Cairo.
