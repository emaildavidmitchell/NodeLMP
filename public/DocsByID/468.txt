	Decha Warashoon (1945-)

After graduating in Fine Arts from Silpakorn University, Bangkok, Thailand in 1969, Warashoon soon established himself as an artist of note, winning many awards in national Thai art competitions. An abstract artist, Warashoon was part of the vanguard of Thai contemporary artists who brought Southeast Asian art to international attention. Warashoonâ€™s time at Silpakorn coincided with an overhaul of art practice teaching methods, which saw contemporary Western modernist styles actively incorporated into the curriculum. He experimented with Abstraction and Minimalism, working across many mediums including painting, printmaking, watercolours and mixed media. Today, Warashoon continues to innovate and develop his artistic style. His most recent works feature geometric and sinuous forms constructed in mixed media, including metal, to create visually compelling works that bring together texture and subtle, often muted colour. His works are often inspired by emotional responses to life experiences. A retrospective of his works was held at the National Gallery, Bangkok in 2003 and in 2007 he was named National Artist of Thailand in Graphic Arts. He currently holds the post of professor at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology at Lat Krabang. Warashoon exhibits regularly both in Thailand and internationally.
