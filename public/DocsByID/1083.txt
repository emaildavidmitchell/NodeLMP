Lambert , George W. (1873–1930)



	George W. Lambert ARA was one of Australia’s most capable portrait painters, war artists and sculptors of the early twentieth century, with considerable finesse and wit. The posthumous son of an American railway engineer working in Russia, he was born in St Petersburg on 13 September 1873. He moved with his family to Württemberg, Germany in 1875, to Yeovil, Somerset in 1881, and arrived in Sydney in 1887, aged thirteen. He studied Art in Sydney with Julian Ashton from 1894 to 1900. In his early paintings he expressed a nationalist sentiment. However, after studying to France in 1900 and moving to London in 1902, his principal work was in portraiture, painted with bravura. During the First World War he served as an Australian Official War Artist, and produced a group of desert landscapes in Palestine with strong forms creating rhythmical patterns. Lambert returned to Australia in 1921, when he completed several significant sculpture commissions and major war paintings including two iconic compositions relating to the Gallipoli campaign. He died in Sydney on 29 May 1930. He exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, from 1904 to 1930, was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1922, and his work was included in a commemorative exhibition of late members in 1933. His work is held in all major Australian galleries and by the National Portrait Gallery, London. He has been the subject of several surveys, and a retrospective was organised by the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, in 2007.
