Rugeles has been the Musical Director of the Teresa Carreño Theatre (1997-2000), Associate Conductor and Artistic Director of the Caracas Municipal Symphonic Orchestra (1982-1987), founder and conductor of the Nova Musica Ensemble, and Director of the Venezuelan Chamber Orchestra Foundation. Since 2009, he has conducted the Simon Bolivar Latin American Ensemble of Contemporary Music.

 

In 2000, for the 70th anniversary of the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra, Rugeles recorded his first CD as a conductor, along with the pianists Edith Peña and Arnaldo Pizzolante. During 2002 and 2003, he recorded seven other CDs with the same orchestra.



A recognised composer, he has a brief catalogue that includes chamber, choral, symphonic, and electroacoustic works. He has received national recognitions such as the Caro de Boesi Composition Prize (1979) and the Municipal Music Prize (1985) for his pieces Somosnueve (for chamber ensemble) and Tanguitis (for piano solo), respectively. Rugeles’s music has been edited and recorded by several labels, including Boosey and Hawkes, and performed all over Latin America, as well as in North America, Western and Eastern Europe, and Hong Kong. 



Rugeles has a wide-ranging and varied musical background that includes diplomas in Voice and Choral Conducting as well as studies in Composition with Yannis Ioannidis in Caracas, and in Composition and Orchestral Conducting at the Robert Schumann Institute in Düsseldorf, under Günther Becker and Wolfgang Trommer. In 1993, Rugeles was elected member of the Executive Committee of the International Society for Contemporary Music, ISCM, and then re-elected in 1995. He is a founder and president (1999-2003) of the Venezuelan Society for Contemporary Music, SVMC. His profound interest and devotion to spreading the music of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries spurred him to organise 11 editions (to date) of the Latin American Music Festival, which began in 1991. He has given international conducting workshops with Sergiu Celibidache, Michel Tabachnik and Franco Ferrara. Numerous composers have dedicated their work to Rugeles, including the Venezuelan composers Diana Arismendi (1962--), Josefina Benedetti (1953--), Beatriz Bilbao (1951--), Inocente Carreño (1919--) and Federico Ruiz (1948--), and the Latin American composers Manuel De Elías (Mexico), Guido López Gavilán (Cuba), Marlos Nobre (Brazil), Carlos Vázquez (Puerto Rico) and Alberto Villalpando (Bolivia).
