Apocalypse Poets
      The Apocalypse Poets (or Apocalyptics) were a network of British
writers centred around the Apocalypse poetry movement, which has itself
been largely forgotten (see Tolley; Martin). Apocalypse poetry, inspired by
a Surrealism stripped of its automatism (Salmon 22), was a reaction to the
poetic dominance of the Auden Generation during the 1930s. Aesthetically,
Apocalypticism dealt in nightmarish images, engaged with mythology, and
meditated on war. Politically, it tended towards anarchism (Salmon 119).
      Poets Henry Treece (1912-1966; photo:

and J. F. Hendry (1912-1986), who were acquainted through their
contributions to the literary magazine Seven, developed an Apocalyptic
manifesto in 1938 in collaboration with Dorian Cooke (1916-2005) (Tolley
101). The following year, Treece and Hendry edited an anthology of poetry
entitled The New Apocalypse (Fortune, 1939). They later anthologized two
more collections of Apocalyptic poetry: The White Horseman (Routledge,
1941) and The Crown and the Sickle (Staples, 1943). By the time The Crown
and the Sickle saw publication, the Apocalypse movement had lost much of
its momentum and, along with another short-lived movement, Personalism, was
subsumed under an emerging New Romanticism (Salmon 2).
      Along with Treece, Hendry, and Cooke, other writers in the Apocalypse
network include: G. S. Fraser, Nicholas Moore, Stefan Schimanski, Norman
McCaig, Philip OConnor, Tom Scott, Vernon Watkins, and most famously, Sir
Herbert Read and Dylan Thomas. Read supported the movement as a director at
Routledge and Kegan Paul publishing, but was not an outspoken member;
Thomas was a reluctant passenger (Tolley 102) who quickly repudiated his
association with this movement (Martin 17).
