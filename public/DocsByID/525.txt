Drissi, Moulay Ahmed (1924-1973 Marrakech, Morocco)



Moulay Ahmed Drissi was a self-taught painter. He painted using oil paints, depicting stylised versions of daily life. Drissi was interested not in straightforward representations, but in showing his coherent worldview, using minimal details in his images of people and landscapes. In 1945, he met painters from Switzerland who encouraged his interests, and, starting in 1948 up until 1956, he began travelling widely around Europe. His first exhibition was in 1952 in Lausanne, and he exhibited for the first time in Morocco in 1957 in Marrakech. That same year, Drissi exhibited his work at the second Alexandria Biennale, and was part of significant early exhibitions of Moroccan modern art including the first Paris biennale (1959) and the exhibition “Deux milles ans d’art au Maroc” (Galerie Charpentier, Paris, 1963). In 1957, Drissi founded the short-lived gallery L’Oeil Noir. He was the focus of an early monograph (1960) in a short series organised by Gaston Diehl of Moroccan painters.
