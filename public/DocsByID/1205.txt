MARKER, Chris (July 29, 1921  July 29, 2012)


Chris Marker was a French filmmaker, photographer, writer and multi-media
artist. He is considered to be the foremost pioneer of the essay film. More
digressive, meditative and playful than traditional documentaries, Markers
films combine observational footage, often from his peripatetic travels,
with ruminative voice-overs. Ironically, his most famous work was his only
foray into fiction, La Jete (1962), a short science-fiction film composed
almost exclusively of black-and-white still photographs. <Image 1> Despite
Markers often secretive and reclusive relationship to the public, his
intimate authorial voice gained him an international cult following.

Born Franois Bouche-Villeneuve, Marker was a writer before he was a
filmmaker. His intellectual roots lay in the popular education movements of
postwar Paris and a mixture of existentialism, surrealism and communism. In
the early 1950s he published a novel, Le Coeur net, as well as an academic
study of the writer Giraudoux. At the publishing house Seuil, Marker and
designer Juliette Caputo oversaw the Petite Plante series of travel books,
experimenting with techniques of image juxtaposition and visual rhyme.
These techniques, borrowed from the 1920s Soviet avant-garde, soon found
their way into Markers early film work. After two credited collaborations
with Alain Resnaisthe discursive documentaries Les Statues meurent aussi
(Statues Also Die, 1952) and Toute la mmoire du monde (All The Memory of
the World, 1956)Marker released Lettre de Sibrie (Letter from Siberia,
1958). The film set forth many features that would characterize Markers
later film-essays: the combination of travelogue footage with an epistolary
voice-over; the suggestive, often provocative, use of counter-point in the
editing; the invocation of animals as both victims and witnesses to human
history; and the filtering of twentieth century events through a
transcendental, yet anonymous, consciousness.

During the 1960s, Markers filmmaking grew increasingly political. His 1961
film Cuba, Si! aimed to document the success of Castros post-revolutionary
society. Le Joli Mai (1963) used newly available sync-sound technology to
capture the uneasy mood of Paris during the Algerian war for independence
and urban modernization. <Image 2> In the late 1960s, Marker became an
active member in the left-wing film collective SLON, chronicling political
struggles in Latin America as well as the workers movement in France.
During the unrest of May 1968, he rallied prominent French filmmakers to
contribute to the agitational series Cin-Tracts. Markers subsequent four-
hour documentary, Le Fond de l'air est rouge (A Grin without a Cat, 1977),
provides a personalized, retrospective tableau of the global lefts rise
and retreat.

Markers most famous film from his later period is his 1983 masterpiece,
Sans Soleil (Sunless). Sans Soleil combines the epistolary meditations of a
fictional freelance cameraman, read by an anonymous woman, with
observational footage of African rituals and postmodern Tokyo. <Image 3>
The film crystallized many of the tendencies latent in Markers earlier
work while reflecting his increasing preoccupation with the
interrelationship of technology, history and memory. In the 1990s, he was
one of the first filmmakers to embrace new media. His CD-ROM Immemory
(1998) transposed his signature concerns to the digital sphere, prominently
featuring his alter ego, Guillaume, a cartoon cat. Animals, notably cats,
have appeared throughout Markers oeuvre. A testament to his international
influence and following, when news of his death spread in 2012 many
informal shrines of toy cats appeared throughout the world. <Image 4>
