Argentine journalist, poet and novelist. Together with his younger brother,
Ral, he was one of the main exponents of the countrys literary bohemia
and avant-garde of the 1920s. Usually included in the group of Florida
(writers oriented towards a renewal of literature), he was ideologically
close also to the group of Boedo, which favored the social and political
commitment of writers.

Tun collaborated with the foremost newspapers and literary journals of
the time (Inicial, Caras y Caretas, Martn Fierro, Proa), and from 1925 to
1931 with the newspaper Crtica, where he was put in charge of a weekly
column on tango, later known as glosa, which included the reproduction of
the lyrics of a tango, accompanied by his exegesis and commentary. He also
collaborated with Noticias Grficas and, starting from 1935, with El Mundo,
both newspapers in which he continued publishing glosas of news, a
peculiar journalistic style, shared by Roberto Arlt, another outstanding
figure in Argentine literature. These glosas were created from an expansion
and re-elaboration of the press cablegram, generating a genre between
journalism and literature, narrative and essay, poetic language and
colloquial language, and incorporating the use of lunfardo, the lingo of
the popular classes.

The topics of his glosas and his literary work  always presented from a
clear position of social and political commitment with the left  define
him as a reporter of big international events (WWII, the Spanish civil war,
the workers strikes and battles) and of daily life in the popular streets
and districts of Buenos Aires in the 20s and 30s, as well as of events
and people of a society that was deeply affected by the economic crisis and
rapid process of modernization. His writings on popular culture in the
lower segments of society, in particular on the music, lyrics and language
of tango, contributed to this genres diffusion to a wider public and to
its recognition as a genuine musical expression of Argentine culture.

Tuns first publication was entitled Tangos (1926) and collected a good
part of his work on tango lyrics for Crtica. His other writings, El alma
de las cosas inanimadas (1927), La rueda del molino mal pintado (1928), and
his main work Camas desde un peso (1932) focus on life in the lower strata
of society and on the negative effects of the economic crisis and process
of modernization. Tun also wrote political satire (El Tirano, 1932) and
poetry, and was the author of film scripts (Maana me suicido, 1942; Pasin
imposible, 1943) and plays. Finally, he composed several tangos, among
which were Pal cambalache, written with Rafael Rossi and recorded in 1929
by Carlos Gardel, and Tengo apuro (1927).
