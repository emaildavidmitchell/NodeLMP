The Athenaeum

The Athenaeum, A Journal of Literature, Science, and the Arts, was
published weekly in London between 1828 and 1921. JOHN MIDDLETON MURRY was
appointed as editor in 1919, recruiting ALDOUS HUXLEY as his assistant.
The magazine featured cultural, scientific and political commentary,
reviews, literary gossip, as well as original poetry and short stories.
Contributors included KATHERINE MANSFIELD, T S ELIOT, E. M. FORSTER,
WYNDHAM LEWIS, PAUL VALRY, EZRA POUND and members of the BLOOMSBURY set
such as VIRGINIA WOOLF and ROGER FRY.

ELIOT produced essays such as The Perfect Critic for the magazine between
1919 and 1920 while working on THE WASTE LAND, quoting writers like JOSEPH
CONRAD and JAMES JOYCE alongside canonical references. MANSFIELD was also
employed regularly at this time, reviewing the work of contemporaries such
as WOOLF, MAY SINCLAIR and DOROTHY RICHARDSON, as well as collaborating on
translations of CHEKHOVs letters. The magazine was the first to publish
WOOLFs short story Solid Objects, and to host an early exposition of
EINSTEINs Theory of Relativity.
