Kenner, (William) Hugh (1923-2003) 



Hugh Kenner is a Canadian-American literary critic, most famous for his life-long work on Ezra Pound. Kenner is also a major critical voice in studies of James Joyce, T.S. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis. In The Pound Era (1971), recognised by many as a masterly work in modernist scholarship, Kenner argues for the centrality of Pound in the development of Anglophone modernism. An immensely rich book which is difficult to summarise, The Pound Era traces modernism’s origins in the years before the First World War, exploring how modernist experimentation with language culminated in the works of Pound, Lewis, Eliot and Joyce. As it focuses largely on the “men of 1914”, the study has attracted criticism from scholars who point out that Kenner’s canon is eccentric, antiquarian and Eurocentric (see, for example, Harold Bloom, A Map of Misreading). Despite his controversial view of modernism, Kenner is universally credited for introducing into modernist studies a new way of criticism, mixing expert philological analysis with imaginative speculation. A prolific critic and devout polymath, Kenner has also written on mathematics, computing, the visual arts and the engineer/architect R. Buckminster Fuller. His archive, including letters from Pound, Eliot, Zukofsky and Davenport, is located at the Harry Ransom Centre.
