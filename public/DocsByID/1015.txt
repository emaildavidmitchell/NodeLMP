Alexander L. Kielland is one of Norways most  important  prose  writers  of
the second half of the 19th century. Born into a rich bourgeois  family,  he
described the rise of the local bourgeoisie and its internal  tensions  from
within. His novels and short stories are bound to  the  Scandinavian  Modern
Breakthrough and to realism in particular. He ended his literary  career  in
1891, and until his death  in  1906  he  was  active  as  a  civil  servant.
Kielland was  among  the  Scandinavian  writers  of  his  age  who  achieved
significant international dissemination,  and  his  works  were  sources  of
inspiration for important modern novels such as Thomas Manns Buddenbrooks.

Alexander Kielland was born in 1849 in  Stavanger,  on  the  West  coast  of
Norway, where his family had been running one of the leading  businesses  in
town for several generations. His debut came with the  collection  of  short
stories Novelletter (1879), followed by the novel  Garman  &  Worse  (1880),
which became one of Norways most important contributions to realist  prose.
The novel portrays the rise of a family of  the  high  bourgeoisie  and  its
internal conflicts. The tensions between the patriarch Garman and  his  sons
are coloured by a contrast between an old and a new way  of  thinking  about
business, which is based on the technological innovations that  had  reached
Norway in the course of modernization during  the  middle  of  the  century.
According to Kielland, the bourgeoisie was  a  disease  of  hypocrisy  and
social conflict, and as a bourgeois himself,  he  was  stuck  in  a  tension
between the social class that  he  belonged  to  and  consciousness  of  its
condition. Writing realist prose, Kielland said, was his way of showing  and
trying to heal such a disease. This is evident in Garman & Worse as well  as
in its prequel, Skipper Worse (1882),  where  Kiellands  interest  for  the
bourgeoisie  as  a  social  class  blends  with  a  detailed   psychological
analysis, especially in the case of the  evil  Madame  Torvestad  and  her
influence on Worse and her two daughters. Here  Kielland  touches  upon  the
issue of arranged marriages and of  the  negative  consequences  of  Pietist
Christianity on society. Kiellands following novels have a marked  critical
agenda, be it against the repressive Norwegian school  system  (Gift,  1883)
or  Christian  morality  (Sne,  1886).   Kiellands   literary   inspiration
gradually faded, and he wrote his last novel, Jacob, in  1891.  He  died  in
Bergen in 1906.
