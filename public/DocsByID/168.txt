Baum’s first book, Frühe Schatten, das Ende einer Kindheit, was published in 1914 and re-released in 1919. She did not have a major success, however, until she published Stud. chem. Helene Willfüer, which sold over one hundred thousand copies within three years. This novel dealt with the very timely issue of the “New Woman,” taking as its heroine a highly educated woman in male-dominated academia and offering a window into the lifestyle of the ‘modern’ contemporary woman in the Weimar Republic. While Baum wished to write and be recognized for more serious literary work, financial necessity led her to sign an exclusive contract with Ullstein, where she also worked as an editor from 1920-1931, and to continue to write the type of ‘pot boilers’ the press demanded of her. Consequently, her novels were never taken very seriously by critics. Even when she finally produced what she felt was an important work of literature, her 1953 book The Mustard Seed, it was received just as her earlier works had been. Baum referred to herself for most of her career as “a first-class writer of the second rank.”



In 1932, after spending time in Hollywood working on the film version of Grand Hotel, Baum immigrated to the United States with her family. This move coincided with the growing anti-Semitism in Germany, and in 1933 Baum’s literary works were banned in the Third Reich. She became an American citizen in 1938; from this point forward, she wrote her works exclusively in English. Over the course of her career, Baum wrote more than 50 novels. At least ten of these were made into Hollywood movies, including Dance Girl, Dance (1940), A Woman’s Secret (1949) , and the  Hotel Shanghai (1997). Baum died of leukemia in 1960. Her memoir It Was All Quite Different was published posthumously in 1964.
