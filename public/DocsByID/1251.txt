|Compositions by Gilberto Mendes have been performed at major musical |
|events in Brazil and abroad, including the Festival de Amrica y     |
|Espaa (Spain), the Autumn of Warsaw (Poland), the Festival          |
|International des Musiques Experimentales de Bourges (France), the   |
|Darmstadt Festival (Germany), the Nutida Musik (Sweden), the         |
|International Festival of Patras (Greece), the Inter-American Music  |
|Festival (Washington, D.C.), the New World Festival of Arts (Miami), |
|and the Sonidos de Amrica (Carnegie Hall, New York).                |
|                                                                     |
|Mendess studies in music began as a hobby, when he enrolled at the  |
|Conservatrio Musical de Santos. At the time, the institution was    |
|owned by the great Brazilian pianist Antonieta Rudge (1885-1974) who |
|accepted Mendes as a pupil. Mendes was not, however, enthusiastic    |
|about his studies until 1944, when he undertook a more profound study|
|of harmony with Savino de Benedicts (1883-1971), a conservative but  |
|highly competent instructor. It was during this time that Mendes     |
|decided to become a composer, and his initial efforts to write music |
|date back to these years.                                            |
|                                                                     |
|His first works primarily consist of short piano pieces (the earliest|
|surviving production is a Preldio [1945]) and songs that demonstrate|
|his classical and romantic influences, which, at times, he combined  |
|with elements of Brazilian folk music. Benedicts tried to give Mendes|
|some orientation in relation to his early work. He did not approve of|
|the harmonic liberties Mendes took, especially the flattened         |
|chromaticisms often employed by his student, which were influenced by|
|American popular radio music (big band music, in particular). Because|
|of the pairs ongoing disagreement with one another, Gilberto Mendes |
|opted to become an autodidact; the only education he acquired during |
|the subsequent years came from his readings of theoretical books, and|
|from a careful study of Benedicts scores.                           |
|                                                                     |
|Cinema was another important influence for Mendes, which not only    |
|inspired him through its music, but also provided him with a personal|
|mythology that he would adopt almost as a religion. Despite the fact |
|that the composer lacked direct contact with musical folklore during |
|his upbringing, nationalism also inspired his works, prompted        |
|primarily by his involvement with the Communist Party during the     |
|1950s.                                                               |
|                                                                     |
|Around this time, Mendes attempted to study with leading nationalist |
|composer Mozart Camargo Guarnieri (1907-1993). After this            |
|unsuccessful attempt, Mendes approached Cludio Santoro (1919-1989). |
|Their contact was brief, and consisted of five lessons in which they |
|discussed the ideological aspects of musical aesthetics rather than  |
|compositional techniques. Despite this, most of Mendes pieces from  |
|the period take a relaxed approach to nationalism, reflecting the    |
|influences of composers such as Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887-1959), and  |
|Ernesto Nazareth (1863-1934) opposed to the preaching of Camargo     |
|Guarnieri and his disciples.                                         |
|                                                                     |
|After Santoros departure to Europe, in 1956 Gilberto Mendes became  |
|involved with a group of musicians who gathered around George Olivier|
|Toni (1926--). Toni (also a communist) freed Mendes from his         |
|ideological concerns, and introduced him to avant-garde techniques.  |
|Works from this period include the Peas para Piano nos. 14-16 and 6 |
|Peas para Piano Solo, from which no. 5 was Mendes first twelve-tone|
|composition.                                                         |
|                                                                     |
|In 1959, during a trip to Europe, Mendes became aware of new trends  |
|in composition, discovering the music of Karlhienz Stockhausen       |
|(1928-2007). Upon his return to Brazil, Mendes immersed himself     |
|along with fellow composers Willy Corra de Oliveira (1938--) and    |
|Rogrio Duprat (1932-2006)  in a study of Integral Serialism that   |
|would result in the works Cantata sobre a Fala Inicial do Romanceiro |
|da Incofidncia (now Cavalo azul, 1961), Msica para 12 Instrumentos |
|(1961), and Msica para Piano n 1 (1962).                           |
|                                                                     |
|In 1962 Mendes and his colleagues attended Darmstadts Summer Course |
|where they expected to receive classes on Integral Serialism with    |
|Stockhausen. Much to their surprise, they found an environment that  |
|had been shaken four years earlier by a series of lectures by John   |
|Cage (1912-1992), whereupon the American composer defended the use of|
|chance and the indeterminacy of music making. That shock was a       |
|turning point for the Brazilian composers who either abandoned art   |
|music altogether, as in the case of Rogrio Duprat and Damiano       |
|Cozella (1929--), or opened themselves to experimentalism, as        |
|happened with Willy Corra de Oliveira and Mendes himself.           |
|                                                                     |
|Upon their return to Brazil, the composers, then a part of the Grupo |
|Msica Nova, published a manifesto in the literary magazine Inveno.|
|The Manifesto Msica Nova advocated for the artists total immersion |
|in the contemporary world, proposing a balance between a formalist   |
|approach to music making and political messaging. During this period,|
|Mendes collaborated closely with avant-garde poets of Poesia         |
|Concreta, a partnership resulting in his most experimental and       |
|celebrated compositions: the choral works. Until then, Mendes pieces|
|were virtually unknown but to select colleagues. His presence in the |
|Brazilian musical scene during this phase of experimentalism would   |
|associate his name, for years to come, with scandal and controversy. |
|                                                                     |
|                                                                     |
|An exemplary work from this period is Motet em R Menor, also known  |
|as Beba Coca-Cola [Drink Coca-Cola] (1966). Based on a poem by Dcio |
|Pignatari (1927-2012), the pieces intrinsic humour conceals a       |
|sarcastic criticism of American imperialism through the manipulation |
|of its main icon. In the poem, Pignatari develops the initial        |
|advertisement phrase through six lines, and in the final iteration of|
|the advertisement, the phrase is transformed into the word cloaca    |
|(which translates both as sewer and rectum). Mendes setting features|
|a similar approach, and he combined a dense contrapuntal texture     |
|permeated with microtonal intervals, with moments of a more direct   |
|engagement with the public, especially after the intended burp (by as|
|many singers as possible) that punctuates the beginning of the coda. |
|Prior to the last measure, the conductor faces the audience, and when|
|applause starts, the choir bursts into a protest-like declamation of |
|the word cloaca, which is also seen in posters waved by the singers. |
|                                                                     |
|                                                                     |
|Direct communication with the audience is characteristic of Mendes  |
|other works from the period, such as Cidade (1964), Vai e Vem (1969),|
|and Asthmatour (1971) for choir, and Santos Football Music (1969) for|
|orchestra, which includes tapes of soccer game broadcasts, and       |
|audience participation.                                              |
|                                                                     |
|In 1975, Mendes career veered from his combative period of          |
|experimentalism. In that year, he finally retired from his bank job, |
|and a growth in productivity was immediately apparent. Pieces from   |
|that period  including Motetos  Feio de Lobo de Mesquita (1975)  |
|for baritone, oboe, violoncello, and harpsichord  feature an        |
|increased emphasis on the instrumental parts, contrasting with the   |
|vocal prominence of the previous works. In 1978, a residency in the  |
|United States  where he taught composition for the academic year at |
|the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee  enhanced Mendes interest |
|in instrumental music.                                               |
|                                                                     |
|In fact, the composers immersion into a culture that he had so much |
|admired, through popular music and movies, would have a direct impact|
|on his subsequent works, such as Qualquer Msica (1980) for chamber  |
|ensemble, and Saudades do Parque Balnerio Hotel (1980) for alto     |
|saxophone and piano. This latter piece features autobiographical     |
|elements  the hotel, destroyed to make way for a shopping mall, was |
|one of the places where Mendes heard popular music during the 1940s |
|that became a specific feature of many of his mature works. In his   |
|later works, he sought inspiration from a number of stars in         |
|Hollywood musicals and artists linked with German Expressionism.     |
|                                                                     |
|In 1981, after a gap of twenty years, Mendes returned to the piano as|
|a creative medium with his Concerto para Piano e Orquestra, the first|
|mature instrumental work to alert critics to his stylistic shift. The|
|reception of the piece was varied, ranging from cautionary critiques |
|to enthusiastic commentaries. In the spring of 1983, Mendes returned |
|to the United States as Tinker Visiting Professor at the University  |
|of Texas at Austin. During that period he continued to write pieces  |
|influenced by jazz, while also re-evaluating his early works,        |
|especially his piano pieces. An example is Recado a Schumann (1983), |
|a work composed while in Austin focussed on a theme developed decades|
|earlier.                                                             |
|                                                                     |
|Upon his return to Brazil, Mendes received commissions to write      |
|choral and instrumental pieces.  The countrys process of            |
|redemocratisation beginning in 1984 prompted him to write politically|
|charged works including Vila Soc Meu Amor (1984), Mame Eu Quero    |
|Votar (1984), Vo Entregar as Estatais!... (1985), 1 de Maio (1986) |
|for choir, and O ltimo Tango em Vila Parisi (1987) for orchestra.   |
|The majority of his instrumental pieces, however, continue to reflect|
|his dialogue with his own past, as is the case with Ulisses em       |
|Copacabana Surfando com James Joyce e Dorothy Lamour (1986), and Um  |
|Estudo? Eisler e Webern Caminham nos Mares do Sul... (1989).         |
|                                                                     |
|More recently, Mendes has enjoyed a renewed sense of appreciation by |
|Brazilian critics and musicologists, who now openly regard him as a  |
|leading figure among contemporary composers.  As a result of this new|
|status, many of his early works are being revived in concerts and in |
|recordings.                                                          |
|                                                                     |
|In his present works, Gilberto Mendes uses a range of techniques     |
|developed since his youth (for example, the use of pervasive         |
|repetition and musical quotation), combined with attempts to         |
|reconcile the tonal and atonal musical universes. His masterful      |
|technique, as well as his juxtapositions of and experiments with form|
|are responsible for the unique sound of his pieces.                  |
