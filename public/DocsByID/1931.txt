Teatro del Pueblo

Teatro del Pueblo [The Peoples Theatre] was the first independent
theatre in Argentina and launched the teatro independiente movement in
Buenos Aires. Founded on November 30, 1930 by the writer Lenidas Barletta
(1902-1975), Teatro del Pueblo rejected both popular and commercial
precedents in its promotion of a modern but socially conscious theatre
available to all. Barletta pushed against popular genres such as the
sainete one-act plays, which he believed, as he asserted in 1938, rendered
a people without moral values, a youth both crude and without ideals
(cited in Verzero 2). Instead, taking cues from French dramaturge Romain
Rollands essay The People's Theatre, he sought a movement that would
restore theatres function as socially productive art. To this end,
Barletta supported original playwriting that resisted established models
while broadening the cultural offering to include conferences, concerts and
lectures open to the public. Two magazines, Metrpolis (Of those that
write to say something) and Conducta (In the service of the People),
also provided a forum for discourse on the theatre.

Teatro del Pueblo was founded at a moment of both local and international
unrest.  Argentinas first military coup deposed President Hiplito
Yrigoyen in September of 1930, following the global economic crash of 1929.
Barletta, a member of the anti-capitalist Boedo group of Argentine writers,
viewed the global crisis as an opening for a socialist theatre movement.
Specifically, he envisioned a group theatre model in which the actor would
double as activist. Members would participate in all aspects of theatrical
production including acting, costume, set design, and ticket sales (Foster
Wallace ix). Teatro del Pueblos democratic organization was manifest in
its pledge to serve all social classes, as was reflected in a photo collage
in a 1938 issue of the Conducta magazine. There, two pictures were
juxtaposed, one with the caption Clara Leloir Unzu and Eduardo Cernadas
attend an audition of Catita for certain members of the aristocracy while
the other described common people attending a communal performance of
Shakespeare in the Teatro del Pueblo (cited in Puga, 32).

In addition to staging contemporary European authors such as August
Strindberg and Eugene ONeill alongside classics by Shakespeare and Lope de
Vega, Teatro del Pueblo emphasized the promotion of original works. Most
influentially, Barletta convinced Argentine writer Roberto Arlt to try his
hand at playwriting and went on to produce Arlts first play Trescientos
millones in 1932 as well as Saverio el cruel (1936), La isla desierta
(1937) and others. The theatre also provided important venue for other
Argentine writers such as Roberto Mariani, Nicols Olivari, and Ezequiel
Martnez Estrada.

The productions were unified by what theatre scholar Osvaldo Pellettieri
characterizes as a realist aesthetic that was not aligned with the
historical avant-garde. The theatre, according to Pellettieri, aimed to
modernize by rejecting previous Argentine theatrical traditions in favour
of European models (70-71). Arlt himself lauded the modernizing potential
of Teatro del Pueblo in a 1932 conference, proclaiming that within a few
years, the theatre would enjoy all the requirements of the modern theatre
such as set, costume and lighting designs customized for each production,
which he hoped would create a national theatre, in consonance with our
problems and our sensibility (cited in Puga 35).

Despite the determination to found a national and modern theatre, Teatro
del Pueblo struggled to establish a permanent location in Buenos Aires. For
the first number of years the theatre floated between venues, and in 1936
moved to a space on Corrientes Avenue with authorization to remain for
twenty-five years. However, in 1943 authorities forced the group to vacate
the space, which was turned into the Municipal Theatre of Buenos Aires.
Teatro del Pueblo then settled in its current location a few blocks away in
the basement of a building on Diagonal Norte.

During Juan Domingo Perns first presidency (1945-1955), Barletta actively
opposed the government, and in particular its policies of censorship and
State propaganda, leading Silvia Sigal to suggest that he was one of the
main leaders of the anti-Peronist coalition of the left (cited in Verzero
5). At the same time, due to the emergence of other independent theatres,
such as La Mscara (1939), Fray Mocho (1951) and Teatro de los
Independientes (1952), Alicia Aisemberg argues, Teatro del Pueblo no
longer occupied a central place in the independent theatre movement (101).
The operations of the theatre were managed personally by Barletta, and when
he died in 1975 the theatre also closed. However, in 1987, through the
efforts of several playwrights, Teatro del Pueblo activities recommenced
once again under the name Teatro de la Campana. In 1996, the theatre
returned to its original name under the leadership of the Foundation of
Playwrights Carlos Somigliana (SOMI). Since then, along with serving as an
important site of cultural heritage, the theatre has staged both original
works by Argentine playwrights as well as revivals of the now classic plays
that were premiered by the Teatro del Pueblo.
