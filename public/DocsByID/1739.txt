SCHUMPETER, Joseph (February 8, 1883, Triesch, Austria-Hungary – January 8, 1950, Taconic, Connecticut)



Joseph Schumpeter was one of the twentieth century’s most innovative and influential economists. He began his studies at the University of Vienna, where he received a PhD in 1906. From there he enjoyed a peripatetic career in academia, finance, and government. He taught at the Universities of Graz, Bonn, and Harvard, and also served as the Austrian Minister of Finance and president of a private bank from 1920-1924. Throughout his many works, he theorized and defended a dynamic form of capitalism, summed up by the famous phrase, “creative destruction.” His approach is outlined in the early work, The Theory of Economic Development (1911), in which he sets up the heroic figure of the “entrepreneur” as the engine of innovative development. In English, his most influential work was probably Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942). Here, he argued that Marx was right that capitalism would collapse, but for the wrong reasons. He foresaw no joyous revolution, but a slow process through which the entrepreneur and his creative destruction would be hemmed in by an increasingly stifling social-democratic state.
