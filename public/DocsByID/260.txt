Branca, Glenn (1948 )

Patrick Nickleson

Glenn Branca (b. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 1948) is an American composer
noted for his works for massed electric guitars. Branca began his
compositional career in New York after working in theatre in Boston. With
his first two bands, The Static and Theoretical Girls, he began combining
avant-garde art music with the No Wave scene of late 1970s New York.
Following these early experiments, Branca started his own ensemble  which
over the years included members of the rock bands Sonic Youth, Swans, and
Helmet  for his albums Lesson No. 1 and The Ascension. His works are
heavily influenced by the esoteric tuning theories of Hermann von
Helmholtz, Dane Rudhyar, Hans Kayser, and Harry Partch. From these writers
and his own early experiments, Branca developed a compositional style that
utilized the clashing of high harmonics at extreme volumes to create an
effect that is often described as ecstatic. While his use of the term
symphony to describe his large-scale works drew criticism earlier in his
career, he has become an extremely prolific writer in that genre; his
Symphony No. 15: Running Through the World Like an Open Razor (for strange
orchestra) premiered at New Yorks Le Poisson Rouge in November 2010.
