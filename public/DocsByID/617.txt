 Ge Fei (1964-)

                                                                 Weijie Song

Born Liu Yong  in Jiangsu province, China, Ge Fei is a fiction writer,
essayist and critic. He graduated from East China Normal University, and
has served as a professor of literature, creative writing, narratology, and
film theory at Tsinghua University since 2000. Ge has established himself
as an avant-garde writer since the mid-1980s. His labyrinthine narrative
structure, poetic precision of language, and experimental meta-fiction
techniques make him a pioneering figure in contemporary Chinese literature.


Ge Fei made his literary debut with a short story,  Zhuiyi Wu
You xiansheng (Remembering Mr. Wu You) in 1986, which concerns a
mysterious death of a village doctor and a book collector. The novella 
Mizhou (The Lost Boat, 1987) won critical acclaim as a representative
work of his early writings, which are characterized by recurring themes
including temporality and recollection, desire and death, and melancholia
and mourning. His novella  Hese niaoqun (A Flock of Brown Birds,
1988) was regarded as the most abstruse tour de force of the Chinese
literary avant garde. Featuring the encounter between the author Ge Fei
and a mysterious young woman Qi (Chess), it challenges narrative
conventions of literary realism by utilizing a circular, complex plot
structure, building a maze of signs and codes that blurs the boundaries
between past and present, illusion and reality, history and fiction.

Ge Fei published his first novel,  Diren (The Enemy), in 1990, followed
by  Bianyuan (Margins, 1992). These novels continued his
experimentation with narrative strategies and the explorations of memory
and representation, sexuality and violence. His third novel, 
Yuwang de qizhi (Banner of Desire, 1996), tells of the lives of young
academics in the humanities in an age of increasing commercialization,
while shifting to the use of more conventional techniques. His fictional
writings of the mid-1990s are subsequently more realistically grounded.

Whereas his early work was deeply influenced by western modernist writers,
in particular Jorge Luis Borges, Ge Feis writings from the 2000s make
great efforts to integrate avant-garde experimentation with traditional
Chinese narrative techniques in engaging with the quotidian details and
vicissitudes of daily life. The result is Ges Jiangnan trilogy, spanning
from the late Qing dynasty to contemporary China. Award-winning 
Renmian taohua (Peach Blossom Beauty, 2004) features a young womans
sentimental romance, her journey toward revolutionary enlightenment, and
the general disillusion of utopian aspirations in the late Qing and early
Republican eras.  Shanhe rumeng (Landscapes in Dream, 2007)
narrates the failure of socialist utopia and the erotic epiphany of a
Communist cadre in the 1950s.  Chunjin Jiangnan (End of Spring in
Jiangnan, 2011) tells of the pleasures and pains of a poet against the
capitalist backdrop of a commercializing China from the 1980s to the early
2000s. The trilogy contemplates the changing ideas of revolution, history,
politics, and the destiny of intellectuals. In 2012, Ge published 
Yinshen yi (Invisible Cloak), which describes the world of classical music
fans, and criticizes greed and chaos in post-Mao market economy.
