Anne Truitt is an American artist most closely identified with Minimalism. Truitt’s art consists of wooden boxes, planks and columnar works that were industrially fabricated and painted by hand, which were among the first examples of Minimal art. Because of the evocative colours and literary titles of her artworks, she is often placed in distinction to her contemporaries who argued against expressivity in art. Truitt’s principal critical ally was Clement Greenberg, despite his viewing other Minimalists’ works with contempt. Greenberg admired Truitt’s formal references to the painters Ad Reinhardt and Barnett Newman, and understood her sculptures as three-dimensional articulations of a two-dimensional painted surface. Elsewhere the language Greenberg used in defence of Truitt made her gender a conspicuous issue, which contributed to the feminising of her practice in ensuing discourse. Truitt had a remarkably long, productive and diverse studio practice, making sculpture, drawings and paintings until she died in 2004.
