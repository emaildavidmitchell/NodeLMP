Jane Ellen Harrison was a classicist credited with being the first woman to obtain a post in England as a ‘career academic’. Her scholarship combined archaeological research with mythology to understand the religious rituals and social practices represented in the art and literature of ancient Greece. Born in Yorkshire, Harrison was among the first students to attend Cambridge University’s newly created school for women, Newnham College. She later studied with Charles Newton (1816–1894) in the Department of Antiquities of the British Museum and began a career as a speaker on archaeology and classical art before her appointment to Newnham as a lecturer in 1898. Her frequent travels to Greece, as well as friendships and correspondences with classicists Gilbert Murray (1866–1957), F. M. Cornford (1874–1943) and other Cambridge Ritualists, prepared Harrison for her two most well-known books, Prolegomena To The Study Of Greek Religion (1903) and A Study Of The Social Origins Of Greek Religion (1912). Both received widespread acclaim and criticism and remain in print today. Associations with Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group significantly shaped her influence on the literary culture of twentieth-century England, where she was considered an outspoken and controversial figure.

The American poet Charles Olson (1910–1970) advocated for Harrison’s research in ancient culture and promoted the psychological and anthropological readings of antiquity she helped establish as an example for his own historical-poetic investigations of place.
