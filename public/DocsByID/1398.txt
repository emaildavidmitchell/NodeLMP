NIHALANI, Govind (December 19, 1940-)



Govind Nihalani is an Indian film director and cinematographer. He is regarded as one of the key figures of the so-called ‘Indian Parallel Cinema’ and ‘New Cinema Movement’ of the 1970s and 1980s, most notably through his camerawork for his more famous colleague Shyam Benegal – e.g., on Ankur (1974) or Bhumika (1977) – and through his own directional ventures Aakrosh (1980, his debut) and Ardh Satya (1983). Nihalani’s early work as director is marked by social criticism and psychological introspection within genre formulas and by his collaboration with playwright and scriptwriter Vijay Tendulkar. Ardh Satya, a bitter cop story sometimes compared to Dirty Harry (1971, Don Siegel), might illustrate best the major departures from Popular Indian Cinema in Nihalani’s work: Though operating with a largely linear narrative, Nihalani is not interested in attractions, doing mostly away with (physical) action and song-and-dance sequences, and instead opts for the Academy format in the film’s cinematography and a deliberately slow, but relentless pace to explore the various forms of institutional and mental violence inflicted upon the main character. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nihalani made a string of adaptations from theatre including Ibsen (Jazeere, 1989), Strindberg (Pita, 1991) and Lorca (Rukmavati Ki Haveli, 1991). His masterpiece though remains the TV mini-series Tamas (1986) which became a highly controversial television event of the eighties. Adapting Bhisham Sahni’s novel of the same name, it stands as one of the major cinematic studies of Partition.
