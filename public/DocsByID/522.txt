Drachmann, Holger Henrik Herholdt (1846-1908)

Holger Drachmann was a Danish writer and painter, active in the period of
the Modern Breakthrough in Scandinavia (1870s-1890s). He was influenced by
Georg Brandes and his radical ideas but later moved towards more national
conservative trends. He was a prominent public figure of his time as well
as a very productive and versatile author. His works range from realistic
and impressionistic poems, novels and travel accounts to national romantic
dramas and historical melodramas. A number of his songs have become
embedded in the Danish popular tradition.

Born in Copenhagen, he was the son of physician Andreas Georg Drachmann. He
entered the Academy of Fine Arts and started a career as a marine painter.
Although he abandoned this path in favour of literature in 1870, he
continued to paint. He is particularly remembered for his seascapes of
Bornholm and Skagen, where he settled in 1904. His interest for the sea and
maritime life had a direct influence on his literary works, as shown for
instance by his poetry collection Sange ved Havet (1875).

Drachmann initially embraced political radicalism and came under the
influence of Georg Brandes, who called for a socially engaged literature
able to make problems a matter of debate. His social concerns and realism
come forth in his early poetry collections: Digte (1872) and Dmpede
melodier (1875). In the 1880s Drachmann distanced himself from Brandes and
his radical ideals and temporarily moved towards more national conservative
views as he started to focus on the representation of Danish folk life and
national feelings.

Drachmann continued to write poetry  Sangenes Bog (1889) and Den Hellige
Ild (1899) are among his later collections  but also devoted himself to
other genres. His dramatic production is characterised by the interplay
between dramatic action and music. His fairy tale-inspired operetta Der var
engang (1885) became a big success as did his translation of Byrons Don
Juan (1880, 1902).

Drachmanns characters are defined by restlessness as they struggle to take
control of their life. This emerges in his first novel, En overkomplet
(1876), but also in his later works. Love triangles are at the centre of
his Tannhuser (1877) and of his most famous novel Forskrevet (1890), in
which he gives modern impressionistic representations of life in
Copenhagen.

Drachmann married three times and had a number of muses in his life. He
considered himself a free spirit and was contemptuous of petit-bourgeoisie
morality. He travelled to several European countries, including Scotland,
England, Italy, Spain, Germany, Holland and Belgium, and wrote several
travel books, examples of which are Med Kul og Kridt (1872) and
Skyggebilleder (1882). He died in 1908 in Hornbk but is buried in Grenen,
near Skagen.
