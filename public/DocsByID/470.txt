Richard Dehmel (1863-1920) was a German poet and author and member of the Schwarzes-Ferkel-Kreis. Viewed from a 21st century perspective, his importance for the modernism movement in Germany can hardly be overestimated. A key figure in overcoming naturalism, he was idolized by an entire generation of young artists and writers at the turn of the century -- amongst others Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Arnold Schönberg, Johannes R. Becher, Else Lasker-Schüler, Paul Zech, Josef Winckler, Gerrit Engelke, René Schickele, Max Brod, Georg Heym frequently sent their works to him for proofreading and saw in him a pioneer of pathbreaking poetry as well as a messiah of an alternative aesthetic world view. He and his followers embarked on a journey through the mystic darkness of the sex(es), through all experiences that the magnetic force of love creates. Novel about this angel of darkness was a mix of archaism, symbolism and allegorism, realist naturalism, sexualism, immoralism and satanism, Nietzschean übermenschdom and visionary originality. Dehmel's poetry inspired numerous composers such as Richard Strauss, Anton Webern, Karol Szymanowski, Kurt Weill and Alma Mahler-Werfel to set his poems to music. Arnold Schönberg's music and dodecaphony were reinforced by Dehmel's poetry.
