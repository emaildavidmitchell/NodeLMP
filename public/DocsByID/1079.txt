Lagerkvist, Pr (1891-1974)
Henrik Johnsson, Institut for stetik og Kommunikation

Born in Vxj, Sweden, Pr Lagerkvist pursued academic studies at Uppsala
University, where he befriended artists associated with the avant-garde in
Sweden. Lagerkvist visited Paris in 1913, where he studied the Cubism of
Pablo Picasso. After a trip to Berlin in 1915 and a period spent in
Denmark, Lagerkvist returned to Sweden and made his literary debut.
Lagerkvist was elected into the Swedish Academy in 1940 and was awarded the
Nobel Prize in literature in 1951.

Lagerkvist's first publications were collections of Impressionist short
stories, Mnniskor (1912) and Tv sagor om livet (1913). His views on
Modernism and the avant-garde were expressed in Ordkonst och bildkonst
(Literary Art and Pictorial Art) (1913). In this essay Lagerkvist argues
that Expressionism and Cubism are rooted in primitive and medieval art,
which is portrayed as being truer to nature than traditional realism.
According to Lagerkvist, art should not strive to imitate reality but
rather to represent its aesthetic significance.

Lagerkvist's essay was widely read and influential among the Swedish avant-
garde. The essay was followed by Motiv (1914), a collection of prose poems,
and Jrn och mnniskor (Iron and Man) (1915), a collection of Impressionist
short stories with themes drawn from the First World War. A collection of
poetry and prose likewise influenced by the war, ngest (1916), marks
Lagerkvist's transition from Impressionism to Expressionism. The collection
established Lagerkvist's reputation as a poet and was followed by a series
of Expressionist plays. Lagerkvist's essay Modern teater (Modern Theatre)
(1918) promotes an anti-Naturalist theatre inspired by August Strindberg
among others.

Lagerkvist became more prolific as a writer of prose in the 1920's, with
texts such as the autobiographical novel Gst hos verkligheten (Guest of
Reality) (1925). During the 1930's Lagerkvist wrote a series of anti-
fascist texts such as Bdeln (The Executioner) (1933) and Den knutna nven
(The Clenched Fist) (1934), in which he promotes a fighting humanism as a
countermeasure against fascism. The poetry collection Sng och strid (1940)
is heavily influenced by the Second World War, while the historical novel
Dvrgen (The Dwarf) (1944) examines the psychology of totalitarianism.

After the war Lagerkvist wrote a series of prose works with themes drawn
from Biblical antiquity, including the novel Barabbas (1950). Other notable
works of this period are Sibyllan (The Sibyl) (1956) and his last novel,
Mariamne (1967).
