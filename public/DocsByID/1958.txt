Héctor Tosar was a composer, pianist, director, and composition teacher in Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and USA. The main characteristic in his works is the compositive principle based on ‘groups of sounds’, and the searching for musical communication by means of expressiveness and lyricism. His catalogue includes soloist works, mainly for piano, as well as symphonic, chamber, and vocal works, and also, in his last period, compositions with new instruments, such as the synthesizer.

Héctor Tosar was a composer, pianist, director, and composition teacher in Uruguay, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and USA. One of the best-known Uruguayan composers of his generation, his works have been presented in festivals worldwide. He started studying piano with Wilhelm Kolischer, harmony with Tomás Mujica, and composition with Lamberto Baldi, and then completed his studies in the USA and France, where he studied composition with Aaron Copland, Arthur Honegger, Jean Rivier, and Darius Milhaud, and orchestral direction with Serge Koussevitzky, Eugène Bigot, and Jean Fournet.



The main characteristic in his works is the compositive principle based on ‘groups of sounds’, and the searching for musical communication by means of expressiveness and lyricism. His catalogue includes soloist works, mainly for piano, as well as symphonic, chamber, and vocal works, and, in his last period, compositions with new instruments, such as the synthesizer. In his book on Uruguayan composer Coriún Aharonián, Tosar divides his work into several stylistic periods: the first is characterized by the use of tonal procedures that become polytonal, or ‘free atonal;’ this period includes various pieces for piano –Sonatina n° 1 and Danza criolla (1940), and Suite para piano (1944), among others - musicalization of texts –like the songs for piano and voice En tu alma, Soledad, and Mundo, with a text by Jacques Després (c 1939); the six songs in Seis canciones de ‘El barrio de Santa Cruz’, with words by José María Pemán (1942), and Solitude, based on a poem by R. M. Rilke (1943), and orchestral pieces, such as his first symphonic work Toccata (1940), directed for piano and orchestra (1941) by Lamberto Baldi, with the Orquesta Sinfónica del Servicio Oficial de Difusión Radioeléctrica (Official Radio-Electric Broadcasting Service's Symphonic Orchestra, OSSODRE).



Between 1946 and 1951, Tosar received the Guggenheim Foundation scholarship as well as scholarships from the French and Uruguayan governments to continue his studies on composition and orchestral direction in the USA and Paris. He composed, among others, Sonata para violín y piano (1948), Momento sinfónico (1949), and Sinfonía para cuerdas (1951), one of the most representative pieces in his catalogue performed in Venezuela, Mexico, and the USA. That same year, Tosar created Oda a Artigas in honour of the centenary of Uruguay's national hero Gervasio Artigas’ birth, a piece for reciter and orchestra with words by Luis Bausero, as well as other songs for choir, with the outstanding Cinco madrigales (1956) among them. Salmo 102 (1957), for soprano, choir, and orchestra, is a piece in one movement, highlighted by Tosar for its ‘exacerbated lyrism’ and use of chromatism which, as in Te Deum (1960), for bass, choir, and orchestra, characterizes the passage towards a wider harmonic freedom. Invited by Juan José Castro, Tosar taught from 1961 to 1966 at the Music Conservatory of Puerto Rico. There, based on the total chromatic, he composed the last of his Cuatro piezas (1961-1963) for piano, with ‘tango rhythm’. The process of his change in style materialized in Stray Birds (1963), for baritone and eleven instruments, inspired on a text by Tagore, in which Tosar used serial procedures with ‘groups of sounds’ to replace harmony, thus creating ‘fixed zones in the musical space’, according to Aharonián (44).



In the seventies, Tosar composed a series of eight Reflejos for various instrumental formations. In 1976, he returned to the piano with Tres piezas para piano, thus beginning a new compositive period, followed by Nómoi and Ecos (1977), and Sul re (1981), a fundamental piece of the period in which the repetition of the D note was considered structural by the composer. From 1979 to 1981, he lived as a composition teacher, first in Venezuela, at the Simón Bolivar Music Institute, and then at Indiana University, in Bloomington, USA. In those years he composed, apart from Sul re, the Concerto for piano and orchestra (1979), Cadencias (1979), for orchestra, and Trio para cañas (1980) as well.



Although Tosar kept on writing instrumental pieces like Cinco piezas concertantes para violín y orquesta (1987) and Septeto (1989), the early eighties marked the last period in his production, characterized by the timbral exploration with the synthesizer. La gran flauta (1988), which uses flute timbres, was followed by Música festiva (1988), characterized by rhythmical exploration, and Voces y viento (1989), with moments of improvisation. His last work, Passacaglia sobre el nombre de Bach (1994), was composed for organ.
