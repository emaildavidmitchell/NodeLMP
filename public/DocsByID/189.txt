Bendre is chiefly known as a poet who inaugurated desi sogadu (charm of nativity) in his poetry. In the early years of his poetic career, he was deeply influenced by the poetry of Khalil Gibran and Rabindranath Tagore. Later on, Aurobindo Ghosh shaped his poetic orientation. Between 1922 and 1978, Bendre published thirty books of poems. The best-known collections of his poetry are Gari (feathers, 1932), Sakhigita (a song of the beloved, 1937), Gangavatarana (the descent of Ganga, 1951) and Naaku Tanti (Four Strings, 1964). The last collection brought him the Jnanpith award in 1973. He was also conferred honorary doctoral degrees by the Universities of Karnataka and Mysore.  



Bendre, whose pen name was Ambikaatanayadatta, borrowed his ideas from many sources but his poetry was distinctly his own. His poetry, according to G. S. Amur, is characterized by continuity and change. Continuity can be identified in concepts that have their roots in the Indian intellectual tradition like the Sankhya philosophy and the four-fold vision (Chaturmukhata). The Sankhya concepts of Prakriti and Purusha are central to the intellectual universe of Bendre’s poetry. 



Another prominent aspect of Bendre’s poetry relates to experiences of ordinary life such as love, family predicament and the conflict between sex, death and love. He composed poems in which the lives of common people assumed elevated elaboration. The best example for this aspect is ‘Kurudu Kanchana’ (Blind Money). In this well-known poem, Bendre reveals how the poor people can become an easy prey to money’s exploitative power. 



The figure of the mother is dominant in Bendre’s poetry. The mother, in various forms, assumes a wide range of meanings in his poems. These poems proclaim journey from the local to the universal. His poem “Naanu” (I) illustrates Bendre’s orientation to universality while remaining firmly rooted in the local. Some critics have suggested that Bendre conceptualized the world through Kannada and its land, foregrounding Bendre’s concern for native elements in his poems.
