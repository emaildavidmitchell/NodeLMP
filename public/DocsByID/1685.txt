Born into a family of Syro-Lebanese origin in Alexandria, Egypt, Georges Sabbagh is an Egyptian painter of the École de Paris. He started painting at the Académie Ranson in Paris in 1910, where he was introduced to Félix Vallotton and Maurice Denis, who had a significant influence on his work. During the First World War, he enrolled in the British army and on his return to France he married the art historian and activist Agnès Humbert. By 1930, he received the French nationality. Sabbagh assimilated the experiences of the Nabis, the Cubists and the Fauves, while searching for a new form of realism. In that sense, together with painters such as Yves Alix, Jules-Emile Zingg and Henry de Waroquier, he belonged to what the critic Jean Cassou called ‘the sacrificed generation’.
