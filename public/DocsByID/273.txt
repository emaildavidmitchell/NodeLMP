Franz Brentano (1838-1917)
Born in Marienberg, Germany, and active as a philosophy professor and
Privatdozent at universities in Wrzburg (1872-73) and Vienna (1874-1895),
Franz Clemens Brentano profoundly influenced nineteenth-century western
philosophy and psychology, also leaving an indelible mark on the natural
sciences, economics and related disciplines. Incorporating Aristotelian
philosophy within the empiricist methods favored by the early nineteenth-
century sciences, Brentano strove to combine the emergent philosophical
modes of introspection with scientific exactitude. A precursor of modern
phenomenology and Gestalt psychology, whose students included Sigmund
Freud, Edmund Husserl and Carl Stumpf, Brentano is best known for concepts
developed in his 1874 work Psychologie vom Empirischen Standpunkt
(Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint), such as intentionality, what
Brentano sees as a central aspect of mental phenomena (88); and
perception, what he reads as a misception or misperception (Wahrnehmung
ist Falschnehmung) (Rollinger 60). For some scholars, the history of modern
western philosophy begins with Franz Brentano, although some of the trends
associated with his legacy counter Modernisms rejection of realism and the
trust in sciences ability to define the nature of reality.
