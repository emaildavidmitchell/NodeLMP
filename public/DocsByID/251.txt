Pierre Boulez is an influential composer and conductor, and considered one of the leaders of the post-war avant-garde. As a composer, he is associated with an atonal modernist idiom; as a conductor, he has sought to change the listening habits of the concert-going public by initiating them, through concerts and recordings, into the classics of modernism from the first half of the twentieth century (Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Webern, Bartók, Berg, etc.). As a music administrator, he has founded many important institutions in his native France, including the Cité de la musique and the music research institute IRCAM (Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/ musique).



Although Boulez dispensed with total serialism after a brief but decisive period, his concern with the formal unity of a work of art remains a central concern throughout his career. Other compositional preoccupations have been the dialectic of freedom and control in a series of open or mobile works such as the Third Piano Sonata and the interface between the performer and digitally processed sound (e.g., in Répons).

French composer Pierre Boulez is an influential composer of the second half of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first. He is considered a leader of the musical avant-garde since 1945. In addition, through his international career as a conductor, he has sought to change the listening habits of the concert-going public by initiating them, through concerts and recordings, into the classics of modernism from the first half of the twentieth century (Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Webern, Bartók, Berg, etc.). 



Boulez’s early works, such as the First Piano Sonata (1946) and the Sonatine for flute and piano (1946) testify to his assimilation of the serial language inherited from Webern and Schoenberg, into which he was initiated through informal lessons by the Polish-born composer René Leibowitz (1913-1972), as well as an approach to rhythm which owes much to his teacher at the Paris Conservatoire, Olivier Messiaen (1908-1992). It was with the publication in 1950 of the Second Piano Sonata (1946-48) that Boulez’s personality came to be publicly identified with the avant-garde. With its violent gestures and overlapping layers, the Sonata conforms to Boulez’s characterization of the piano as ‘the instrument of frenzy’.



In 1951-52, Boulez experimented with integral or total serialism, in which the proportions of a tone row are used to regulate the succession of durations, dynamics and timbres. This technique, which would prove decisive for Boulez’s musical thinking despite his abandoning the strict application of its rules, is showcased in the frequently analysed Structures pour deux pianos, entitled Book One (1951-52). Boulez originally gave the first piece the telling title ‘At the Limit of Fertile Ground’, after a painting by Bauhaus artist Paul Klee. This attempt was born of a desire to unify musical discourse, a goal to which Boulez would aspire by other means in later works. 



As a music administrator, Boulez has always applied himself to founding durable institutions. In 1954, the Domaine musical, the concert society he founded, produced its first concert of decidedly avant-garde leanings in Paris, presenting concerts of major works from the pre-war atonal repertoire (Schoenberg, Webern and Berg) as well as new compositions by a younger generation of composers. 



Boulez’s most famous work remains Le Marteau sans maître (1952-55), in which Boulez created a sound world meant to correspond to the surrealist poetry of René Char. The exotic instrumentation of the Marteau was consciously chosen to evoke the traditional music of Japan, Bali and Central Africa. 



Many of Boulez’s compositions remain unfinished, even if various successive versions have been heard in concert and committed to recordings, such as Répons (1980-82), the Third Piano Sonata (1955-57; 1963), ... explosante-fixe ... (1991–93). This tendency to constantly expand works (sometimes decades after their first composition) can be traced to Boulez’s fascination with James Joyce’s Finnegan’s Wake and the Stéphane Mallarmé’s poetics. 



Poésie pour pouvoir was an aborted attempt from 1957 to marry instrumental sound (that of an orchestra) with pre-recorded tape. This characteristic combination of instrumental and electronic sound was to be a perennial source of inspiration for Boulez, leading him, in the 1970s, to found IRCAM, a Parisian institution devoted to the development of interactions between musicians and technology. ‘Real-time electronics’, in which the sound of an instrument is modified and broadcast through speakers in the concert hall virtually instantaneously, remains one of Boulez’s chief preoccupations, one that he has put into practice in several works which combine instrumental and electronic sound, such as Dialogue de l’ombre double, ...explosante-fixe..., Anthèmes 2, and especially Répons.



In works such as Éclat (1965), the second book of Structures pour deux pianos (1956/61), and Domaines for clarinet with or without ensemble (1961-68), Boulez explored the possibilities of various forms of open-endedness (what he calls ‘works of mobile trajectory’). Explaining his attraction to mobile forms, Boulez invokes the poetic ideal of Stéphane Mallarmé, who had planned a ‘Livre’ [‘Book’], an immense unfinished project of poems that could be explored by the reader in a variety of directions, a project which was reconstructed with much aplomb in 1957 by Jacques Scherer. In a passage that must have struck the thirty-two-year-old composer, Scherer wrote that for Mallarmé, ‘in order to eliminate [chance] even more radically, the Livre refuses the passivity of unilinear continuity and develops in a hyperspace in a great number of dimensions as it has been imagined by non-Euclidean geometry’.



In later decades, Boulez’s work reveals a growing interest in large-scale form. The turning point might well be Rituel in memoriam Maderna, a work from 1975 of some twenty-five minutes’ duration. Sur Incises, composed in successive versions between 1996 and 2006, runs to some forty minutes, while Dérive 2, in the most recent version revised in 2009, runs to a full forty-five minutes. 



Boulez’s catalogue forms a rich and varied corpus. Although Boulez dispensed with total serialism after a brief but decisive period, his concern with the formal unity of a work of art remained a central concern throughout his career.
