Aurelio Tello (Malpartida) (1951–)

Rafael Leonardo Junchaya

Aurelio Tello is a Peruvian composer, conductor and musicologist. Since 1982, he has lived in Mexico. Tello has been awarded several prizes and distinctions, not only as a composer but also as a researcher. His main research subject is Latin American colonial music, particularly from Mexico and Peru; it also includes 20th-century music. He has published analyses, critiques, and historical accounts of composition and composers from Mexico and Peru. In 1989, Tello founded the Capilla Virreinal de la Nueva España ensemble, devoted to a Latin-American colonial music repertoire.

Aurelio Tello was born in Cerro de Pasco, in the central highlands. He studied choral conducting and music education at the National Conservatoire of Peru. He also studied composition with Enrique Iturriaga (1918-), Edgar Valcárcel (1932-2010), and Celso Garrido-Lecca (1926-). In 1974, Tello took part in a workshop on popular song promoted by Garrido-Lecca at the National Conservatoire. One year later, he attended a workshop on musical research with César Bolaños and Fernando García. Tello began his career in 1973 as a choral conductor, conducting several ensembles in Peru and Mexico. In 1980, he recorded 20th-century Peruvian choral and vocal compositions with the National Conservatoire’s Choir. Since 1986 he has been guest conductor of the Mexican Coro de Madrigalistas de Bellas Artes. In 1989, he founded the Capilla Virreinal de la Nueva España, a vocal and instrumental ensemble devoted to Latin-American colonial music, which has participated in several festivals and concerts and has made some recordings.

Aurelio Tello moved to Mexico in 1982, where Manuel Enríquez invited him to lead the musicological research department of CENIDIM (Centro Nacional de Investigación, Documentación e Información Musical “Carlos Chávez” / National Centre for Musical Research, Documenting and Information). Tello has published several books, articles, and collections, as well as musical scores devoted to Mexican composers from the Colony, such as Manuel de Sumaya and Gaspar Fernandes. He has contributed several volumes of the collection Tesoro de la música polifónica en Mexico [Mexican Polyphonic Music Treasure]. He also edited musical collections from the cathedrals of Oaxaca and Puebla in Mexico and Barroco Musical Peruano [Peruvian Baroque Music]. Tello wrote his master’s thesis in Musicology on the songs with continuo from the Sutro codex. He is an active visiting lecturer in Latin-American universities, and has published in music periodicals such as Plural, Pauta, Casa de las Américas’ Música and Revista Musical Venezolana. Tello is also a contributor to the Spanish and Latin-American Music Dictionary with more than one hundred entries. He was awarded the National Prize in Research by the INBA (Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes of Mexico) in 1994, and in 1999 he received the Prize in Musicology from Casa de las Américas (Cuba) for his Cancionero musical de Gaspar Fernandes. He was also awarded the INBA Prize of Academic Excellence in 1999 and 2001.

As a composer, Aurelio Tello studied at the National Conservatoire of Peru. He later attended complementary courses in analysis with Mario Lavista, Heber Vásquez, and Carl Schachter. His choral composition Trifábula (1983) received an honourable mention in Colombia’s Ciudad de Ibagué’s composition contest, and in 1987 he received the first prize in the Peruvian Banco Central de Reserva’s choral contest for his Poema 9. Tello’s compositional language is modernist, combining techniques like serialism and minimalism with traditional music. His Dansaq (1984–6) is a series of three different compositions based on the music for the traditional ‘Danza de tijeras’ from the southern Andes of Peru. The first of these pieces was written for solo violin and dedicated to Manuel Enríquez, while the second was written for string quartet and has been premiered and recorded by the Cuarteto Latinoamericano. Another piece that shows the use of traditional music is Ichuq parwanta, which exist also in three different versions, the last one for marimba and piano (1998). Since the 1990s, he has been interested in working with one personal set/series. To this group belong Elogio de Falami [Praise to FAE, 1991], Canción de cuna para despertar a un negrito [Lullaby for waking up a little black boy, 2000, text by Nicolás Guillén] and his concerto for harp and string orchestra (2002), among others.
