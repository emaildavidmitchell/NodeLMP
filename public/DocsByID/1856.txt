Sprachkrise (Crisis of Language)



The Sprachkrise stemmed from the perceived incongruity between linguistic expression, conceptual thought, and the immediacy of lived experience. It was largely a fin-de-siècle phenomenon, to which Nietzsche’s pointed question in an essay from 1873 gave early voice: “Is language the adequate expression of all realities?” The notion of a crisis of language is a fundamental aspect of modernism and the avant-garde at large, in particular with relation to literary production and philosophical thought, though it is often discussed in the context of Viennese modernism. Here, the key thinkers, aside from Nietzsche, are the philosopher Fritz Mauthner, the writers Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Karl Kraus, and the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and, later, the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle.
