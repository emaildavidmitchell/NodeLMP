YOSHIDA, Yoshishige (February 16, 1933–) 

Yoshida Yoshishige (known also as Yoshida Kijū) is a Japanese film director associated with the Japanese New Wave. He entered the Shōchiku film studios in the mid-1950s and served as assistant to veteran directors such as Kinoshita Keisuke. Yoshida directed his first film, Rokudenashi (Good-for-nothing) in 1960 when he was still in his twenties. He continued making films for the studio even after some of his cohorts quit, blaming Shōchiku for intervening in their work. However, after parts of his Arashi o yobu juhachi-nin (Eighteen Who Cause a Storm, 1963) were cut without his permission (particularly the ending), he decided that his next film for the studio, Nihon dasshutsu (Escape from Japan, 1964) would be his last there. He consequently left the studio to become an independent filmmaker. With such works as Erosu + gyakusatsu (Eros + Massacre, 1969) and Kaigenrei (Coup d'Etat, 1973), Yoshida reached a zenith of modernist filmmaking, as these films exemplify his film theory which calls for the negation of the self and a subjectivity that is not defined by dominating the other. In addition, Yoshida also published theoretical writings on film, including a critical rethinking of the cinema of Ozu Yasujirō, Ozu's Anti-Cinema (2003).
