Juan Orrego-Salas was a Chilean composer and musicologist. Born in Santiago, Chile on January 1919, he began his music education in Santiago, while also pursuing a career in architecture, obtaining a diploma in architecture in 1943. He studied composition with Humberto Allende and Domingo Santa Cruz, while also teaching music courses at the Universidad de Chile and Universidad Católica de Chile. By 1949 he dedicated fully to music composition, abandoning his career as architect. Under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation, he studied music composition with Aaron Copland in Tanglewood and with Randall Thompson at the University of Virginia and University of Princeton. Orrego-Salas also studied musicology with Paul Henry Lang and Georg Herzog at Columbia University. He returned to Chile in 1947 joining the faculty of the Universidad de Chile as full professor, and as choral conductor at the Universidad Católica de Chile. During 1949 he traveled through Europe, conducting the world premiere of his Canciones castellanas, Op. 20, selected for the XXIII Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music (ISCM) in Palermo and Taormina, Sicily. Upon returning to Chile he assumed the editorship of the Revista Musical Chilena. These years were followed by a prolific compositional career, completing commissions for new works for a variety of ensembles including orchestras and chamber groups.

Upon returning to Chile he assumed the editorship of the Revista Musical Chilena. These years were followed by a prolific compositional career, completing commissions for new works for a variety of ensembles including orchestras and chamber groups. Orrego-Salas received the title of Profesor Extraordinario (Distinguished Professor) of composition from the Universidad de Chile in 1953. He received a second Guggenheim Fellowship, allowing him to dedicate a year to music composition in New York. Back in Chile he fulfilled several administrative positions, including director of the Instituto de Extensión Musical, and founder and first director of the Departamento de Música (now Instituto de Música) of the Universidad Católica in Santiago. In 1961, he left his positions in Chile to establish and direct the Latin American Music Center at Indiana University with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, also teaching composition at Indiana University’s School of Music in Bloomington. He retired from IU as ‘Professor Emeritus’ in 1987.



Musically he began his studies during Chile’s nationalist period with Domingo Santa Cruz as one of its proponents, however, his music moved away from the previous generation’s overt nationalism. The second world war prevented him from pursuing further studies in Europe, which led him to form ties with composers and music circles in the US and Latin America. One can categorize Orrego-Salas’s output under two rubrics, instrumental music and vocal music. His instrumental compositions explore varied and unusual combinations of instruments, such as tuba and cello quartet in De profundis (1979). He also employs twelve-tone technique after his Symphony No. 4 (1966). His music also reflects contemporary compositional techniques through his use of melody, harmony, timbre, texture and form. Much of his vocal works set poetry by Spanish writers, mainly those from the middle ages, Renaissance and The Golden Age. After moving to the US his vocal music reflects a stronger preference for Chilean texts, setting Pablo Neruda’s poem in his cantata América, no en vano invocamos tu nombre (1966). Later he used the text from the book of Genesis, and the writings of Pablo Neruda and Dylan Thomas for his oratorio The Days of God (1974-76). 



Orrego-Salas has received commissions from Koussevitzky, Coolidge, Kindler, Wechsler, Riley, and Steiner foundations, the Louisville Orchestra, the National Symphony of Washington, Cornell University, University of Miami, Trinity University, Santa María University, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Inter-American Music Council, Frei Foundation, the Colegio de Arquitectos in Chile, as well as chamber ensembles, soloists and individuals.
