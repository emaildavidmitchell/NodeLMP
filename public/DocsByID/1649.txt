Training

As a child, Robinson studied rhythmic dance (danse rythmique) with Yvonne Redgis at her Paris studio. She went on to study piano with Yvonne Lefébure and returned to dance in 1941, studying with a Wigman-trained teacher, Erina Brady, in Dublin where her family settled as refugees during the Second World War. After the war, she took classes with the Jooss-trained dancer Segurd Leeder, theatre workshops with  Mytho Bourgoin and Ludolf Schild, and in 1947 danced in Mila Cirul’s Chemin de la vie (Path of Life) at the choreographic competition sponsored by the Archives Internationales de la Danse (AID) in Copenhagen.

Here she met Françoise and Dominique Dupuy.  They became very close friends and over the next several decades undertook many collaborative teaching projects.  A major turning point came in the 1950s when Robinson attended Mary Wigman’s workshops in Montreux (1952) and in Berlin (1956). She described the encounter with Wigman as a revelation and would incorporate the latter’s vision into her own teaching and composition classes, providing her students with tools for developing their own choreographic language.

														

Contributions to the Field and to Modernism

Robinson’s achievements can only be understood through her simultaneous and complementary engagements in dance. She founded her first school, the Jacqueline Robinson Dance Studio, in Nottingham in 1947, two years before settling in Paris. In 1955, with the strong encouragement of Pierre Tugal, the former AID director and head curator, Robinson founded the L’Atelier de la Danse at her Avenue Junot home in Paris with a goal of fostering the development of danse d’expression – or ‘expressive dance’ – through teaching, conferences and exhibitions, and by promoting research on the fundamentals of dance practice. Her pioneering school initiated a three-year professional dance training in 1961 when contemporary dance had yet to receive state recognition and sponsorship. Described by Robinson’s biographer Geneviève Piguet as neutral in stylistic orientation, the Atelier offered a well-rounded dance education intended to develop versatile dancers rather than a curriculum based on a codified technique. Dancers such as Jerome Andrews, Laura Sheleen and Susan Buirge taught at the Atelier, as did the painter Basil Rakoczi and the dance notator Jacqueline Challet-Haas, making it a truly international venue.

														

														Robinson made her debut as a dance critic in the early 1950s, contributing articles to the magazines Art et danse (Art and Dance) and Danser (Dancing). Convinced of the importance of promoting contemporary dance through the written word, she published Les Cahiers de l’atelier de la danse (The Journal of the Dance Studio) from 1962-1975. Faithful to transmitting knowledge outside the dance studio, she wrote about dance teaching in L’Enfant et la danse [(The Child and Dance, 1988) in addition to translating Wigman’s The Language of Dance and Humphrey’s The Art of Making Dances into French.

														Passionate about memory and history, in 1990 she published her seminal work L’Aventure de la danse moderne 1920-1970 (The Modern Dance Adventure 1920-1970), which revealed, according to Dominique Dupuy, yesterday’s roots in today’s dance. In 1996 Robinson reconstructed Stèle (Stone) for the French-based Argentinian choreographer and dancer Marylén Breuker. Originally choreographed in 1969, the reconstruction was based on materials from Robinson’s archive, now in the collection of the Institut Mémoires de l’Edition Contemporaine (Institute for the Preservation of Contemporary Publishing Archives, IMEC). This is one of France’s largest dance repositories and a major source for the study of the country’s modern dance tradition.

														

Legacy

														A committed activist, Robinson was associated with major French professional bodies such as the Syndicat national des auteurs et compositeurs (SNAC, National Union of Authors and Composers, SNAC), the Conseil national de la danse (National Council of Dance), as well as the Rencontres internationales de danse contemporaine (RIDC, International Association for Contemporary Dance). She headed the Fédération française de la danse (French Federation of Dance) from 1978-1982 and became a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in 1999. She taught generations of French contemporary dancers, such as Christine Gérard, Alexandre Witzman-Anaya, Nathalie Collantès and Stéphanie Roussel.

														Jacqueline Robinson Archives

														The Jacqueline Robinson Archives were given to the Institut Mémoires de l’Edition Contemporaine (IMEC) in Normandy in 1999. The series of materials under the heading JRB include manuscripts, work diaries and scrapbooks, editorial archives, trade union material, photographs, correspondence, press books, costumes and materials of her school L’Atelier de la Danse. The highlight of the archives is the collection of choreographic notes and programmes spanning 1935 to 1999 related to Robinson’s career as a dancer, choreographer and, finally, the head of one of the first professional contemporary dance schools in France. The Jacqueline Robinson Archives also hold collections given to Robinson by two friends and colleagues – the Swiss modern dancer Anne Gardon (1910–1999) and the Spanish composer Francisco Semprun (1928–1986) – making it the memory site of the international artistic family of modern dancers in France.
