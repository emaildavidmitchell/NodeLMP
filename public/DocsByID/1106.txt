Leacock, Richard

Frank Verano (University of Sussex)

British-born documentary filmmaker Richard Leacock (1921-2011) was a
pioneer in ideological and methodological approaches to early 1960s
observational documentary, predicated on the use of the new lightweight,
handheld cameras and portable synchronous sound recording equipment
associated with American direct cinema. Leacock referred to his approach as
the Living Camera, through which he sought to communicate what he
expressed as, simply, the feeling of being there. Revolutionary
technological breakthroughs developed by Leacock, producer Robert Drew, and
filmmakers D. A. Pennebaker and Albert Maysles in the early 1960s allowed
for sound and image to be recorded in complete synchronisation independent
of any physical connectivity, and gave filmmakers a new way to observe and
interact with the world. Leacocks style went beyond candid observation by
demanding a participative role in the unfolding action.  As demonstrated in
his seminal Happy Mothers Day (1964), the Living Camera bears the marks
of physical contact with the profilmic world, and seeks communication with
the films social actors, a process in which the recording of direct sound
is crucial.

In 1968, Leacock cofounded the MIT Film Section with fellow documentarian
Ed Pincus. Upon retiring in 1989, Leacock relocated to Paris, where he
continued to make films until his 2011 death.
