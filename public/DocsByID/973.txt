KAAGAZ KE PHOOL (1959)



Kaagaz Ke Phool bears the distinction of being the first Indian film shot in CinemaScope. It also remains the last official work by actor-director-producer Guru Dutt who stopped taking directional credit after the commercial failure on its release in 1959. The story, most often understood in quasi-autobiographical terms, concerns a director shooting another filmic version of Bengali novel Devdas (most famously adapted in 1935 and 1955 by P.C. Barua and Bimal Roy respectively) while struggling with the separation from his wife and daughter and his budding relationship with the newcomer he found to play Paro. A companion piece to Pyaasa (1957), the dark, melancholic mood is partly attributable to the film’s imaginative black-and-white photography created by Dutt’s key collaborator and eminent director of photography V.K. Murthy. The delicate chiaroscuro effects and complex mise-en-scène conceived by Dutt and Murthy evoke the expressionist style of classical Hollywood productions like Citizen Kane (1941, Orson Welles). After Kaagaz Ke Phool, Dutt ghost-directed Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1960, M.Sadiq) and Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam (1962, Abrar Alvi) (Rajadhyaksha/Willemen: 93), eventually committing suicide in 1964. Today, Guru Dutt is seen as a major, albeit eccentric figure within Indian Popular Cinema – with Kaagaz Ke Phool as his most radical expression.
