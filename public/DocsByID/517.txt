Nelson Pereira dos Santos (1928, São Paulo) is a Brazilian actor, screenwriter, film critic and theorist, producer, and director. He can be considered the initiator of modern Brazilian cinema. His first feature, Rio: 40 Graus (Rio 100 Degrees Farenheit, 1955), jump-started the cinema nôvo (New Cinema) movement that would dominate Brazilian vanguard cinema throughout the 60s and early 70s. Throughout his more than 50 years of filmmaking, Pereira dos Santos has continued to shape the Brazilian screen. Como era gostoso o meu francês (How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman, 1971) is his most internationally known film; a departure from his earlier neo-realist style, it started a more self-critical phase that reflects on the instability of all ideologies and registers the disappointment with the Left in Brasil following the onset of the military dictatorship in 1964. The late 70s films attempted to create what he called a popular cinema, rejected theoretical treatment, and sought to convey the views of ordinary citizens. He has continued to be an influential filmmaker in the so-called New Brazilian Cinema of the 90s and today, with political films such as Brasilia 18% (2006). The majority of his films are based on literary adaptations from Brazilian authors and since 2006 he belongs to the Brazilian Academy of Letters—the first filmmaker to be nominated.
