Keun, Irmgard (1905-1982)


Irmgard Keun was an acclaimed and popular novelist in Germany during the
final years of the Weimar Republic (1918-1933), whose works reached an
international audience in the 1930s and 1940s. Known for their irreverent
humour and their nave yet canny female narrators, Keuns novels captured
the precariousness of life in late Weimar Germany. Blacklisted by the
National Socialists in 1933, she went into exile in 1936 and continued to
write novels that cast a critical eye on the petit-bourgeois milieu and its
submission to fascist barbarism. Keun returned to Germany in 1940, but her
postwar life was marked by financial hardship, alcohol abuse, and mental
and physical breakdowns.
Born in 1905 in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Keun moved with her middle-class
family to Cologne in 1913. After completing her secondary education in
1921, she worked as a stenographer and typist before beginning formal
theatrical training in 1925. From 1927 to 1929, she worked as an actress in
Cologne, Hamburg, and Greifswald with only mild success. In 1929 she began
writing novels, publishing Gilgi, eine von uns in 1931 and Das kunstseidene
Mdchen (The Artificial Silk Girl) in 1932. Both of these bestselling
Weimar-era novels have young, sexually liberated, working women as
protagonists who grapple with shifting gender roles and economic
uncertainty. Although Keuns works are often cited as examples of New
Objectivity in literature for their cynical wit and their seemingly
dispassionate portrayal of modern urban culture, they also reflect
Expressionism in their moments of emotional immediacy, jarring changes in
narrative voice and tempo, and references to popular films and hit songs.
Keuns novels expose the tension between the reality and the media-
generated fantasy of the 1920s New Woman, and yet their open endings resist
proclaiming womens emancipation to be a failed enterprise.
At the height of her fame in 1932, Keun married the theatre director and
writer Johannes Tralow; they divorced in 1937. Unable to publish her works
in National Socialist Germany, Keun lived in exile from 1936 to 1940
primarily in Belgium. In 1936-37 she traveled throughout Europe with her
companion, the writer Joseph Roth, and in 1938 she visited her lover Arnold
Strauss in the United States. While in exile she published several novels,
most notably the anti-fascist text Nach Mitternacht (After Midnight, 1937).
When her suicide was erroneously announced in a British newspaper in 1940,
Keun returned to Germany under an assumed name and lived in her parents
home in Cologne until the end of the war. Beginning in 1977, Keun and her
works enjoyed a resurgence in popularity when the Claasen publishing house
reissued her books. She was the first writer to receive the Marieluise
Fleier Prize of the City of Ingolstadt in 1981.
