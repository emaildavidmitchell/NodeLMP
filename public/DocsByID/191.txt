Shyam Benegal (b. 14 Dec 1934, Trimulgherry, Hyderabad, India - )

Shyam Benegal, a prolific New Indian Cinema filmmaker and the nephew of
filmmaker Guru Dutt, is best known for middle cinema, so called because
his films tread the path between mainstream popular Hindi cinema and
Indias parallel cinema and enjoy popularity with both kinds of audiences.
While he has produced and directed television programs (for instance,
Nehrus Discovery of India [Bharak Ek Khoj, 1988]), he is celebrated as a
filmmaker of socially conscious, quasi-realist films that explore post-
independence modernity and focus on issues of caste, gender, religion, and
village life. The social-realist style he employs is influenced by Italian
neo-realism and Soviet cinema, and shares aesthetic and political
characteristics with filmmakers like Bimal Roy and Satyajit Ray.

Benegals films reveal the conflicts between modernity and tradition, but
in markedly different ways from popular cinema. For example, Mammo (1994)
focuses on Muslim identity and the tragic repercussions of partition and
communal violence. Critiqued and celebrated for sharing the Nehruvian
vision of secular modernity as well as showing its failures, his films
provide an alternative history of India by complicating notions of national
progress through his portrayal of lower caste people and women. In Ankur
[The Seedling, 1973], Bhumika [The Role, 1977], Mandi [Market Place, 1983]
and Hari Bhari [Fertility, 2000] he presents strong, unconventional women
as his subjects and explores concerns as diverse as oppression of dalit
women, female stardom, prostitution, and reproductive rights.
