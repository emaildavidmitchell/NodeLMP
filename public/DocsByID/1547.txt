Pollock, Jackson (1912-1956)                 Word Count: 1051

Jackson Pollock was one of the leading figures of the Abstract
Expressionist movement in mid-twentieth century America. He began his
career working for the Federal Arts Project, but is predominantly known for
pioneering the drip technique in which, using sticks and brushes, the
artist dripped paint onto the horizontal canvas. Hans Namuth famously
filmed and photographed Pollock painting in 1951. Pollock was the focus of
a number of American art critics in the 1950s, particularly of Harold
Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg. Although unnamed, Pollocks method of
working was the implicit content of Rosenbergs The American Action
Painters (1952) in which the act of painting becomes the central focus of
the work. It is Pollocks canvases that take centre stage in Greenbergs
historicisation of modernist painting which followed a formalist
trajectory of French painting through to contemporary American painting in
the 1950s (this was later expanded in the 1960s to include the high
modernist painters who develop from Pollock). The attention given to
Pollocks method of painting further fostered the scrutiny of Pollock
himself.  His subsequent characterisation in popular culture as the manic-
depressive who struggled with alcoholism somewhat clouded an understanding
of his contribution to modernist painting in later years.

In the 1930s Pollock studied under Thomas Hart Benton at the Arts Student
League in New York.  Pollocks early work had many influences; alongside
the work of Benton, Pollock drew inspiration from the Mexican muralists 
in particular, the scale of the murals - and the work of the North American
Indians. In 1935 Pollock started work in the Federal Art Project, initially
in the mural division and later moving to the easel painting division.
Pollocks early paintings have spiritual/mythic titles, which refer to
ideas of the unconscious, and adopt a totemic imagery (in 1948-52 he
abandoned such titles, opting instead to number his paintings). In the
1940s, Pollock adopted the psychic automatism of Surrealist writing,
developing an automatic painting technique based on this psychoanalysis-
inspired process. Alongside William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell, he
attended Roberto Mattas informal workshops during which Matta taught
pictorial automatism. However, the automatism of the New York painters
differed from that of the Europeans, emphasising the completed work (with
which the latter were largely unconcerned). Motherwell termed the Abstract
Expressionist technique plastic automatism in an attempt to illustrate
the distinction between the two. The influence of psychoanalysis in
Pollocks practice can further be traced back to his treatment for
alcoholism in 1939, which used the technique of Jungian psychoanalysis.

The role of Pollocks wife, Less Krasner, also a painter, is often
downplayed in narratives of his career; however, Krasner played a key role
in introducing him to important figures and techniques. In 1941, Pollock
met Krasner while working on a group show curated by the artist John
Graham. Krasner introduced Pollock to artists such as Willem de Kooning and
Hans Hofmann, and the critics Rosenberg and Greenberg, the latter of whom
would play a leading role in Pollocks popularity among the art elite. In
1942 Motherwell and Baziotes introduced Pollock to Peggy Guggenheim, the
then-owner of Art of This Century gallery in New York and wife of
Surrealist Max Ernst. In 1943, Art of This Century hosted a solo exhibition
for Pollock.  As a result of the exhibition, Alfred H. Barr purchased The
She Wolf (1943) for the Museum of Modern Art. Greenberg reviewed the show,
claiming that Pollock was the greatest painter of his time. Following the
success of the exhibition Guggenheim placed Pollock on a retainer of $300
per month. The same year, she commissioned a mural for her town house,
which measured eight by twenty feet, providing a scale and technique that
would be replicated in the later drip paintings.

After marrying in 1945, Pollock and Krasner moved to Long Island where they
purchased a farmhouse with five acres of land. It is here that Pollock
developed his all-over drip paintings, beginning in 1947, in which
Pollock abandoned imagery entirely. While painting, Pollock moved
physically around and sometimes into the horizontally laid canvas (which
collected marks and detritus, such as cigarette butts) leading Allan Kaprow
to argue in 1958 that Pollock was in his paintings. In 1947, Guggenheim
returned to Europe and Betty Parsons became Pollocks dealer. The drip
paintings premiered in Parsons gallery in January 1948 and were ridiculed
by the general public, but not the art world. In 1949 Pollock graced the
cover of Life Magazine with the headline: Is Jackson Pollock the Greatest
Living Painter in the United States?

In his paintings of 1950, the drip paintings grew more condensed with a
limited palette. Pollock showed thirty-two such paintings at Parson's
Gallery in 1950, including Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) and One (Number 31).
The editorial staff of Art News praised the exhibition as one of three
outstanding solo shows of the year. Pollock's work was publicized widely
(including a Cecil Beaton fashion photo shoot in the exhibition space,
later published in Vogue), yet the only painting sold from the show was
Number 1(Lavender Mist) (1950). The same year Hans Namuth approached
Pollock to ask to film him working. As a result 500 photos and two films
(one black and white and one colour) were produced in 1951. The films and
photographs produced by Namuth were central to the characterization of
Pollock as an expressive, performative painter who is inseparable from his
paintings. Pollocks spoken narrative within the film affirms these ideas.

From 1954-55 Pollock virtually abandoned painting; he drank heavily and
suffered from depression. As if already predicting his demise, Greenberg
used the past tense to refer to Pollock in his 1955 essay, American-type
Painting, stating: he went beyond late Cubism in the end. Despite this,
there was still public interest in his work, marked by Time Magazines 1956
Jack the Dripper piece. On 10 August 1956, Pollock drove his car off the
road whilst under the influence of alcohol, killing himself and Edith
Metzger, one of the two passengers in the car.
