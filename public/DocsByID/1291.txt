|Modernism has an uneasy relationship with popular music and popular  |
|culture in general. Many modernist music movements (the twelve-tone  |
|school of Schoenberg, for instance) were diametrically opposed to    |
|popular music in both form and aesthetic. Though hardly uniform in   |
|its attitude to popular culture, certain strains of modernist thought|
|(the Frankfurt school, and Theodor Adorno, in particular) have       |
|vilified the use of popular culture references in modernist          |
|practices. Despite this, several modernist composers from Igor       |
|Stravinsky to Philip Glass have used popular music forms such as jazz|
|and rock in their works. Modernist and experimental music techniques,|
|however, have had a profound influence on various popular forms      |
|including free jazz, experimental rock, and electronica.             |
|                                                                     |
|Numerous modernist composers were exposed to jazz in the 1920s,      |
|culminating in a series of modernist-jazz hybrids including Darius   |
|Milhauds The Creation of the World (1923) and George Gershwins     |
|Rhapsody in Blue (1924). Stravinsky famously wrote the Ebony Concerto|
|(1946) for jazz clarinetist Woody Herman. Later modernist composers  |
|including Louis Andriessen and Michael Nyman incorporated jazz as    |
|part of their on-going musical language, creating a new form of large|
|chamber music that merged the jazz ensemble with the small orchestra.|

|A sustained relationship between modernist experimentalism and       |
|popular music was established in the 1950s and 60s. This connection  |
|can be primarily attributed to two factors: the establishment of free|
|jazz by musicians such as Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane, and the |
|influence of the avant-garde on the Beatles through John Lennons    |
|association with Yoko Ono.                                           |
|                                                                     |
|Free jazz used more complex meters than traditional jazz, and        |
|employed pantonal and atonal harmonic languages directly linked to   |
|similar modernist experiments. Classic free jazz albums include      |
|Ornette Colemans Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation (1960), John |
|Coltrane's Ascension (1965), and offshoots such as Miles Davis      |
|Bitches Brew (1971). Davis was deeply influenced by Elektronische   |
|Musik and Karlheinz Stockhausen, and much of his work in the 1970s  |
|uses avant-garde techniques. Later artists who explored free jazz    |
|include John Zorn, who used jarring juxtapositions within            |
|semi-improvised settings, as heard in Naked City (1990).             |
|                                                                     |
|The avant-garde of the 1960s had a deep effect on the rock music of  |
|the era, including The Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|
|(1967), which used tape-editing techniques similar to musique        |
|concrte. The Beatles experimentalism reached its peak on The White |
|Album (1968), most notably on Revolution 9, a track eschewing the  |
|normal verse-chorus structures of pop music, and instead basing its  |
|form and sound on collage. Around the same time, a number of         |
|musicians in the US and Europe began to fuse the avant-garde with    |
|rock forms. Chief among those were Frank Zappa, an ardent admirer of |
|Boulez who recorded a series of experimental rock albums with The    |
|Mothers of Invention, and The Velvet Underground, who had a direct   |
|link to minimalist composer La Monte Young through their             |
|violist/bassist John Cale. The Velvet Underground had a particularly |
|lasting influence on experimental rock, primarily through their use  |
|of drones and noise within relatively constrained pop music forms.   |
|                                                                     |
|In the late 1960s and early 1970s there was an explosion of          |
|experimental rock, including several German bands such as Can, Neu!, |
|and Faust. Two members of Can (Holger Czukay and Irmin Schmidt) had  |
|studied with Stockhausen, and they brought his tape editing          |
|techniques and improvisational ideas to a rock form. Between 1969 and|
|1974, Can released an astonishing body of avant-garde rock unique    |
|both in its sustained experimentalism, and its adherence to funk-rock|
|rhythms. Their Tago Mago (1971) is considered by many to be the best |
|experimental rock album ever recorded. Groups such as King Crimson,  |
|Henry Cow and Soft Machine also produced a number of albums fusing   |
|rock, free jazz, and the avant-garde, and a number of modernist      |
|composers began using rock timbres and techniques in their work,     |
|including Philip Glass in Einstein on the Beach (1975-76).           |
|                                                                     |
|With the advent of punk in 1977, its general insistence on adhering  |
|to the basics of rock curtailed the influence of the avant-garde     |
|within rock music. Towards the end of the 1980s, however, a number of|
|electronica artists began to appear. Many of these artists referred  |
|to 1970s experiments with ambient electronics including those of     |
|Tangerine Dream and Brian Eno, but also to minimalist composers like |
|John Cage, and to stochastic techniques. Chief among those were      |
|Autechre, who fused dance-based electronica with minimalism while    |
|also using algorithmic techniques in their more recent work, and     |
|Aphex Twin who combined ambient music with dance-music (notably,     |
|Aphex Twin collaborated with Philip Glass on Donkey Rhubarb [1995]). |
|Parallel to these developments, a new form called Japanese Noise     |
|Music integrated experimental rock, free jazz, and noise with the    |
|electronic avant-garde. The results were often extreme, as           |
|exemplified by the work of Merzbow, who famously released a punishing|
|50-CD box set entitled Merzbox.                                      |
|                                                                     |
|The electronica and noise music of the 1990s produced an explosion of|
|experimental popular music similar in impact to that of the 1970s.   |
|This continued in the new millennium with musicians such as Fennesz, |
|David Sylvian, and Bjrk. The fusion of avant-garde experimentalism  |
|and popular music has now become so complete that it is not an       |
|exaggeration to say that musicians working in popular experimental   |
|forms are now continuing the work of the avant-garde more visibly    |
|than classical composers coming from a more traditional modernist    |
|perspective.                                                         |
