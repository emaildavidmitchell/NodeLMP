Hartley, Marsden (1877-1943)						Word Count: 223

Marsden Hartley was a modernist painter and writer whose work covers a variety of styles from abstractions to still-life. After leaving school at fifteen to work in a factory, Hartley moved to Ohio where in 1898 he received a scholarship to attend the Cleveland School of Art. It was there that Hartley became acquainted with the American spiritual and philosophical movement Transcendentalism after receiving a copy of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Essays (1841). The following year Hartley enrolled at the New York School of Art and in 1909 received his first solo exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz’s 291 gallery. Hartley’s fascination with mysticism manifested itself in his paintings of grandiose mountains, Native American motifs, and religious iconography. In addition to his home state of Maine, Hartley came to love Germany.  Historically, Berlin was known for being tolerant of homosexuality and this in conjunction with the city’s vibrant cultural scene exhilarated Hartley, who scholars believe to have been gay.  It was there in the 1910s that he produced two of his most famous series, Amerika and War Motif. In addition to publishing treatises on art, Hartley wrote an autobiography, Somehow a Past (1933).
