Stevens, Wallace (1879-1955)  [Insert Paratextual Material Note 1
(Picture)]
Wallace Stevens is recognized as one of America's greatest modernist poets,
yet he was not widely celebrated for his poetry until the last years of his
life in the early 1950s. Stevens was a private man who was in many ways
quite different from his poetic contemporaries and the other great American
modernist writers. His unusual trajectory as a poet was circumscribed by
the relatively late age at which he began to publish, by his lack of
foreign travel, by an at times unhappy marriage, and by his consuming work
as an insurance lawyer and vice-president at the Hartford Accident and
Indemnity Company. Nonetheless, Stevens' poetic world was immense, and his
verse exhibits his preoccupations with the nature of poetry itself and with
the complex relationship of the mind, the imagination, and reality. Stevens
published his Collected Poems in 1954 at the age of 75 to great acclaim and
died the following year of stomach cancer.

      Wallace Stevens was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on October 2, 1879
to Garrett Barcalow Stevens, a prosperous lawyer, and Margaretha Zeller. On
both sides of his family, Stevens was able to trace a long and influential
American heritage, and through his mother's Dutch origins, he counted
himself among the descendants of the first European child born in New
Holland. Stevens attended Harvard University for three years as a "special
student," meaning that he did not enrol to receive a degree. At Harvard,
Stevens first began to write poetry, which especially in those early stages
showed the influence of the Romantics and the Aesthetes. Through his
interest in poetry, he also befriended the philosopher George Santayana,
who was then teaching at Harvard. After university, Stevens followed his
father's wishes and attended the New York Law School. During a visit home
to Reading, he met Elsie Kachel and was struck by her beauty. His family,
however, frowned upon the match because they saw Kachel as uneducated and
lower-class. Nonetheless, Stevens married her five years later in 1909,
which caused a permanent rift between him and his father, who soon passed
away in 1911. The Stevenses moved to New York, where Wallace worked first
as a journalist and then a lawyer. The young couple rented an apartment
from Adolph Weinman, a sculptor who made a bust of Elsie that was most
likely later used as his model for the famous 1916-1945 "Winged
Mecury"American dime.[Insert PTM 2]
      Stevens, now more established, was able to give more of his time to
writing poetry, and his first significant publication was four poems in the
November 1914 issue of Poetry Magazine when he was thirty-fie years old. By
1916, Stevens had moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where he would remain for
the rest of his life as an executive and later vice-president of the
Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company. His first book of poetry,
Harmonium, was published in 1923 by Alfred Knopf, who would remain Stevens'
main publisher for most of his career. This early volume shows Stevens'
interest in French Symbolism, pure poetry, Imagism, and abstract painting.
Harmonium came out when Stevens was forty-four years old, an uncommonly
advanced age for a serious poet to release a first book. The volume did not
sell more than a hundred copies, but it was positively reviewed by Marianne
Moore in the Dial and contained several poems that are now among Stevens'
best known: "The Snow Man," "The Emperor of Ice-Cream," "Sunday Morning,"
"Anecdote of the Jar," "Peter Quince at the Clavier," and "Thirteen Ways of
Looking at a Blackbird." Over the next years, Stevens did not publish any
poetry, due mainly to his commitments to the insurance company and to his
family, which now included a daughter, Holly Bright, born in 1924. Stevens
did not drive, and so he walked 2.5 miles to and from work each day,
sometimes composing new poetry as he walked. To commemorate his life in
Hartford, there is now an official "Wallace Stevens Walk" in that city that
retraces his steps from the insurance company at 690 Asylum Avenue to his
former home at 118 Westerly Terrace. Locations of interest along the walk
are marked by thirteen Connecticut granite stones, each of which are
inscribed with a stanza from "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird."
[Insert PTM 3]
      When Wallace Stevens reemerged as a poet in 1931, he first re-
released Harmonium with the addition of fourteen new poems. In 1936,
Stevens published Ideas of Order, which was more successful but at the same
time stirred controversy following a negative review in the Marxist journal
New Masses that charged him with indifference toward the social plight of
the working classes during the Great Depression. Stevens was certainly
concerned with such social issues, but his poetry in Ideas of Order was
centred on issues of philosophy, perception, the purpose of poetry, and the
effects of the loss of religious belief. He did try to reflect the social
value of art in his next short collection, Owl's Clover (1936), but the
attempt was largely unsuccessful and Stevens did not reprint the book.
During the mid-1930s, Stevens travelled extensively for work and was
especially impressed by the Florida Keys and the small group of American
writers who often gathered there, including Robert Frost, Archibald
MacLeish, and Elizabeth Bishop. Famously, it was in Key West that he lost a
fistfight with Ernest Hemingway in which Hemingway knocked Stevens down
several times and Stevens broke his right hand punching Hemingway in the
jaw.
      Stevens' next major poetry collections followed in rapid succession:
The Man with the Blue Guitar (1937), Parts of a World (1942), and Transport
to Summer (1947), which includes the important long poems "Notes Towards a
Supreme Fiction" and "Esthtique du Mal." Stevens' poetry during this
period is marked by a much different poetic style than his earlier verse
and a greater meditative turn toward philosophical problems of
consciousness and perception. He saw poetry as a philosophical vehicle
exceptionally well equipped to explore these issues and also to question
the nature and purpose of poetry itself in a self-reflexive manner.
Critical appreciation for Stevens' skill grew during this period, and he
was elected in 1946 to the National Institute of Arts and Letters. In 1950,
he released The Auroras of Autumn, which included "Large Red Man Reading,"
"A Primitive Like an Orb," and "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven." For this
volume, Stevens was awarded the second annual Bollingen Prize for the
year's best work of American poetry, the National Book Award, and the
Poetry Society of America's Gold Medal.
      In 1951 followed The Necessary Angel, a collection of essays on his
central theme of reality and the imagination, and in 1953 Faber and Faber
released Stevens' Selected Poems in England. The culmination of Stevens'
writing career was his Collected Poems, which was published in 1954 by
Knopf and included a section of new poetry entitled The Rock. Critical
acclaim surrounded the release of the Collected Poems, and Stevens was
invited to read his poetry publicly at several venues.[Insert PTM 4]
Stevens was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and a second National
Book Award for the collection, and he received honorary doctorates and even
declined an offer from Archibald MacLeish to be the Charles Eliot Norton
Professor of Poetry at Harvard for 1955-56. The following year, in 1955,
Stevens died of stomach cancer. Even in death, he proved a private and
mysterious figure because of claims made by a Catholic priest, Father
Arthur Hanley, that Stevens converted and was baptized before his death,
which was adamantly denied by his daughter Holly. [Insert PTM 5]
      Stevens took an intense joy in life and in meditating upon the
problems of poetry and our perceptions of the world. His poetry is full of
seasons, colours, animals, imagination, symbols, and food. He took pleasure
in these things even as he pleasured in art, in the sound of words, and in
the importance of poetry. As Stevens argued at the end of his career in his
1955 acceptance speech for the National Book Award for his Collected Poems,
"We can never have great poetry unless we believe that poetry serves great
ends." [Insert PTM 5]
