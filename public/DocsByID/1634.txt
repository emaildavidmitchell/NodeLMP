Richards, I. A. (1893–1979)

Ivor Armstrong Richards

Ivor Armstrong Richards was a leading British critic of the twentieth century. Born in Cheshire and educated at Cambridge, Richards founded his reputation on his ability to evaluate problems of meaning in communicative acts. His contributions led to the development of modern literary criticism, especially New Criticism. He drew on philosophy, rhetoric, semantics, semiotics and aesthetic theory to illustrate how language works by usage, rather than by prescriptive rules. While taking forms of poetry as the basis of his study in the 1920s, he developed with C. K. Ogden (1889-1957) methods of close reading that brought attention to contexts of interpretation.

His contributions led to the development of modern literary criticism, especially New Criticism. He drew on philosophy, rhetoric, semantics, semiotics and aesthetic theory to illustrate how language works by usage, rather than by prescriptive rules. While taking forms of poetry as the basis of his study in the 1920s, he developed with C. K. Ogden (1889–1957) methods of close reading that brought attention to contexts of interpretation. Early books like The Principles of Literary Criticism (1924) and Practical Criticism (1929) focus primarily on interpretive possibilities in poetry, emphasizing that readers can easily arrive at textual misunderstandings. His interest in communication and psychology led him to rhetoric as a way to address ‘misunderstanding and its remedies’ (Richards 1936, 3). The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1936) introduced concerns that remain influential in rhetorical studies today, especially concepts regarding the metaphoricity of language, meaning and context in the formation of thought. A popular classroom teacher, Richards contributed significantly to the development of modern English Studies.
