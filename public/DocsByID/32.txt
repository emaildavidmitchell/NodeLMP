Training

Dai was the granddaughter of a wealthy plantation owner who emmigrated to Trinidad from Guangdong in the late nineteenth century. From age eight to fifteen, Dai studied ballet in Trinidad with Nell Walton. After moving to London in 1931, she continued studying ballet with Anton Dolin, Marie Rambert, Margaret Craske, and Lydia Sokolova. Despite her accomplishments, Dai faced discrimination, likely on the basis of her ethnicity. While in England, Dai became interested in German modern dance and studied with Lesley Burrows-Goossens, then at Dartington Hall with Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder, where she received a scholarship. Dai performed briefly with the Ernst and Lotte Berk Modern Dance Group. In 1940, with support from the London Chinese Institute repatriation fund, Dai travelled to Hong Kong to study Chinese dance. In 1941, she arrived in Mainland China just as the country was in full-fledged war with Japan. In China, Dai studied Chinese folk and ethnic dance by conducting field research trips among rural and ethnic minority communities. She used these dances as the basis for her choreography throughout the 1940s.



Contributions

Dai’s first choreographic works were created to raise money for war relief efforts organised by overseas Chinese in London in the 1930s. In these and later works, Dai used dance to express the suffering of Chinese civilians, war victims, and the poor. In the 1940s, Dai began creating original dance works inspired by Chinese folk and ethnic dances discovered during field research. She performed tours of these dances in the cities of Chengdu, Chongqing, Guilin, Guizhou, and Shanghai. Her historic 1946 ‘Borderlands Music and Dance’ performance in Chongqing became the basis for later developments of folk and ethnic minority dance in China. During and after the 1950s, Dai was instrumental in developing Chinese ballet. Between 1963 and 1966 Dai was artistic director of the Central Ballet of China. Although she suffered political persecution in 1966-75 due to the Cultural Revolution, she was officially rehabilitated in 1975 and served as the Ballet’s artistic advisor until her death in 2006.



Legacy

Dai Ailian is one of the most celebrated figures in twentieth-century Chinese dance, both in China and abroad. Her choreographic style is characterised by innovation, using mixed elements of ballet, modern dance, and Chinese folk and ethnic dance. Stories of wartime suffering and elements of Chinese folk dance adapted from field research appear in many of Dai’s works, which reflect either the everyday lives of Chinese people or aspects of Chinese history and cultural heritage expressed in inventive new forms. While Wu Xiaobang fought the use of ballet in Chinese dance, Dai supported ballet and helped make it a lasting part of Chinese dance education and performance. In its content and form, Dai’s choreography and teaching helped set the foundation for the socialist realist dance tradition that shaped much of dance in twentieth century China. Throughout her life, Dai used her international connections and background to serve as an international ambassador for Chinese dance, and she facilitated numerous collaborations between Chinese dancers and choreographers as well as dancers and choreographers in Europe and the United States.
