Stepanova, Varvara Fedorovna
Born 5 November 1894 in Kaunas, Lithuania
Died 20 May 1958, Moscow, USSR

Although making her mark as an innovative painter in Moscow exhibitions of
1920, it was as a designer that Varvara Stepanova is particularly known.
Between 1921 and the late 1940s, she designed sets and costumes for the
theatre and film (1922-1926), textiles and practical clothing for both
women and men, creating a new look for the new Soviet citizen (from
1924), and she taught textile design at the art school, VKhUTEMAS, in
Moscow from 1923. Under commissions from the State, Stepanovas graphic
design began in 1923 in which she gave a new look to the aspirations of
the Soviet regime in books, magazines, journals and the celebration albums
of the 1930s and 1940s. This new look was determined by geometrical
models: circular patterns using a pair of compasses, linear designs using
the ruler, contrast of light and dark, repeat pattern inspired by film, or
simply by the potential of geometry. Stepanova assimilated the human
figure, photomontage, and pure design into a visual whole made possible by
her method: the modern principles of creating with geometrical models. This
was the constructive process and its principles were described by Stepanova
in her articles  On Non-Objectivity Creativity in Painting (1919), On
the Possibility of Cognizing Art (1920), Construction (1920), On
Constructivism (1921), On Facture (1922), Photomontage (1928), Draft
Syllabus for a Course in Artistic Composition in the Textile (c. 1925),
From Clothing to Pattern and Fabric (1929), How We Worked on The First
Cavalry (1936).
