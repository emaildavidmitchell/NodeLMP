Costa Rican architect Hernán Jiménez-Fonseca obtained his degree at the Universidad Autónoma de Mexico (UNAM) in 1970. Like many Costa Rican architects of his generation, he trained abroad since there were no architecture degree courses in the country until 1971. After settling back in Costa Rica he designed the National Bank Agency in Puriscal, which was built in 1973. However, it was in 1976, when he won the competition for the Costa Rican Association of Engineers and Architects building, that there came a turning point in his career. With its monumental concrete structure and distinctive form, the building became a significant reference in Costa Rican architecture. Throughout his career, and alongside his designs for residential, religious, and institutional architecture (Pinares Apartment Block, 1980; Turrialba Catholic Church, 1999; Fire Station in Puriscal, 1982), Jiménez-Fonseca won a number of important competitions, such as the National Assembly in 1991 (unbuilt) and the National Centre for Culture in 1994. He was also a member of the Jury for high-profile urban projects such as the Square for Democracy. As a competition-winner and jury-member, Jiménez-Fonseca left a lasting and influential mark on the urban setting of the country’s capital.

A further aspect of Jiménez-Fonseca’s valuable contribution to Costa Rican architecture is his long-standing effort to enhance its academic culture. In 1975, he became part of the first School of Architecture at the University of Costa Rica, holding the post of professor from 1997 until his retirement in 2005. His teaching focused on the language of section, plan, and facade as a means of structure and volume design. He was also particularly attentive to a certain ‘truth-to-materials’ ethos (his architecture is chiefly composed of exposed concrete and brick), and to the organisation of spatial qualities in terms of firmness, robustness, and stability.
