Born in Irapuato, Guanajuato, Mexican architect Enrique del Moral Domínguez (1906-1987) moved to Mexico City as a child. There, he studied architecture (1923-1928) in the National School of Beaux Arts with Juan O’Gorman and José Villagrán García, his teacher and mentor. Educated in the post-revolution years, he was interested in the construction of an architecture corresponding to Mexican identity – which had been in a continuous struggle between the new and the old – and building for the needs of the people.

There, he studied architecture (1923-1928) in the National School of Beaux Arts with Juan O’Gorman and José Villagrán García, his teacher and mentor. Educated in the post-revolution years, he was interested in the construction of an architecture corresponding to Mexican identity – which had been in a continuous struggle between the new and the old – and building for the needs of the people. Del Moral was part of the generation which found in functionalism a way to respond to their historical moment. Even so, he intended to integrate international modern architecture with Mexican culture and geography — what he called the global and the local.  



His professional experience after graduating began in 1936, in partnership with Marcial Gutiérrez Camarena, with a housing complex in Irapuato where both pure forms and regional expressions were incorporated. After this, he designed further housing projects, a hospital, and education buildings. In 1946 he developed a rural primary school in Casacuarán, a modern building constructed with vernacular methods: crude timber and brick. Del Moral designed his own house in Tacubaya, Mexico City (1948-1949), where he explored the combination of a modern structure, traditional materials and various textures. He also examined the separation of public and private areas and their connection with the exterior: the former around the garden and the latter towards the patio — a reinterpretation of Mexican typology. 



Del Moral became a professor at the National School of Architecture in 1934 and evolved into director a decade later (1944-1949). During this period he examined ideas about artistic changes, modernism, and Mexican architecture in a series of essays. As a director he got the opportunity to coordinate and design, with Mario Pani, the master plan for the University City (UNAM) and the Rectory Tower (1947-1952). The campus was a functionalist complex in combination with the local topography and references to pre-Columbian configurations. The Rectory Tower was a modern structure mixed with Mexican materials and murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros, where Del Moral explored his interest in plastic integration.



From the 1950s on, Del Moral continued his work developing private and public projects: La Merced Market in Mexico City (1956-1957) was one of the latter. There he proposed a low-cost concrete and brick vaulting solution with an inventive expression. He also developed a series of hospitals and institutional buildings in this period, as well as housing. Through architectural expression of evolving social values, the work of Enrique del Moral demonstrates the transition from post-revolutionary Mexico to a modern country.
