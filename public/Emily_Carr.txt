Emily Carr (1871 – 1945)					Word Count: 195



Canadian painter Emily Carr was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on December 13, 1871, the second youngest of nine children in a middle-class English family. Western Canada in the nineteenth century offered few opportunities for engagement with art, so Carr spent several years abroad learning her craft in San Francisco, Paris and London. In 1927, Carr was invited to participate in a major exhibition of West Coast art at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. There she met other Canadian artists including the influential Group of Seven. Carr’s early work was influenced by European Modernism, specifically Post-Impressionism and Expressionism. It is characterized by vibrant colours and active brushstrokes.  Between 1899 and 1933, Carr visited a number of remote villages from Vancouver Island to Alaska. The landscapes, monumental sculptures and Indigenous peoples she encountered during her travels dominate her later work. Emily Carr died on March 2, 1945 after suffering a heart attack, in Victoria, British Columbia.
